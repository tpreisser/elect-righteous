  // Article body
  whoTheyAre: `Tracey Robert Mann, born December 17, 1976, is a fifth-generation Kansas farmer from Quinter who became a commercial real estate broker in Salina before entering politics. He grew up on the family's Gove County farm — an operation still active today — and attended Kansas State University, earning a B.S. in Business Administration before returning to western Kansas to work the land and build a real estate career.

Mann first entered public life when he won a seat in the Kansas Senate in 2009, representing Senate District 36. After a narrow loss in the 2010 Republican primary for the KS-01 congressional seat, he returned to private business for nearly a decade. He re-entered the congressional race in 2020, won the Republican primary, and defeated Democrat Kali Barnett in the general election with 67% of the vote. He has since been re-elected in 2022 and 2024 by similar margins, cementing KS-01 as among the most reliably Republican districts in the nation.

Before entering Congress, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values — a Washington-based faith leadership program. He and his wife Audra have four children and live in Quinter. His congressional biography foregrounds his farming identity and stated commitment to rural Kansas values.`,

  theirRecord: `Mann serves on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His tenure has centered on four areas: agricultural policy, including the Farm Bill and crop insurance programs; border security legislation; energy production and opposition to green energy mandates; and fiscal conservatism, including opposition to large spending packages. Heritage Action rates him at 96%, placing him among the most conservative members of the House.

On January 6–7, 2021, Mann voted to object to certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes, citing "election integrity" concerns. This vote placed him among the 147 House Republicans who maintained their objections even after the Capitol breach earlier that day. Mann has defended the vote in subsequent constituent communications, framing it as responding to voter concerns rather than endorsing the attack.

Mann also voted against the bipartisan ROTOR Act — legislation that would have expanded drone delivery infrastructure in rural areas. The bill had support from agricultural organizations and rural broadband advocates, and its failure drew criticism from rural development groups. Mann has not offered detailed public comment on the vote.

Key legislation Mann has supported includes the Secure the Border Act, the REIN IN Inflation Act, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and the Energy Independence and Security Act. He has consistently voted against large omnibus spending packages and opposed expanded federal social programs.`,

  whatYouShouldKnow: [
    "Voted against certifying Arizona AND Pennsylvania's electoral votes on January 6, 2021 — one of 147 House Republicans to do so after the Capitol breach that same day.",
    "The only member of the Kansas congressional delegation to vote against the ROTOR Act, bipartisan legislation that would have expanded drone delivery routes in rural and agricultural communities.",
    "56.71% of his campaign funding comes from PACs — with only 0.72% from small-dollar donors (under $200). The majority of his individual grassroots support comes from larger donors.",
    "His single largest donor category is the Crop Production industry ($197,200), representing large agricultural input corporations — chemical, seed, and fertilizer companies — rather than individual family farmers.",
    "He served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values prior to Congress — a faith-based leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C.",
  ],

  whereTheyWorship: `Mann attends First Covenant Church in Salina, Kansas, affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church denomination — a theologically centrist Protestant tradition with roots in Swedish pietism. Before his congressional career, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values, a Washington-based nonprofit that runs faith-oriented leadership programs for high school and college students. His public statements frequently invoke faith as a personal anchor, though he does not typically make church policy a campaign centerpiece.`,

He later quit his federal job to enter the Senate race in March 2026. Hart's public identity includes his party switches and his family discussion about running. He switched from independent to Republican and then to Democrat in early 2026, and he says the decision to run came after prayerful and tearful conversations with his wife and family. Public sources describe him as Christian, but no denomination or church was verified.",
    "theirRecord": "Hart does not have an elected voting record, so the public trail is mostly his legal work and his campaign launch. His strongest professional credential is more than 20 years in criminal justice, including work on cases involving children and cybercrime. His Senate campaign launched late and immediately drew attention because of the party-switch sequence and his deliberate outreach to Republicans. His campaign also uses a law-and-order frame that tries to make him legible to Kansas voters who are not automatic Democrats. That means the public record is still mostly his biography and campaign statements rather than legislative actions or officeholder decisions.",

Schmidt's public identity is rooted in family and service. The public record describes him as married to Megan and coming from six generations of Kansas farmers, miners, and teachers. He entered the Kansas Senate in January 2025 after winning District 19 in 2024, making him the only current elected officeholder in the Democratic Senate field.",

He has made property tax relief one of his main issues and broke with his party to support a constitutional amendment that would cap annual property-value increases for tax purposes. He also sponsored Senate Resolution 1706 condemning the pardons and commutations for people involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. His public career before the Senate was military rather than political. He says the January 6 attack helped motivate his move into politics, and his campaign frames him as someone who understands both national security and Kansas governance.

Her USDA role gave her a statewide footprint, because she worked in all 105 Kansas counties and led efforts to reduce red tape in federal programs.

    "whoTheyAre": "Erik Murray is a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Kansas City, Kansas. He is a commercial real estate developer and entrepreneur whose public identity is tied to the proposed Midtown Station redevelopment at the former Indian Springs Mall site in Wyandotte County. Public reporting describes that project as a nearly $1 billion mixed-use development with housing, retail, childcare, job-training, transit, and energy components. Murray grew up in Kansas City, Kansas, attended Sumner Academy, and later studied at the University of Southern California, where he met his wife Nicole. After years in California, including roughly a decade in Oakland and San Francisco, he returned to Kansas in 2023. His raw file ties him to Eastside Innovation Kansas, Oak Impact Group in Oakland, and the Indian Springs redevelopment effort in Kansas City, Kansas. He has never held elected office. His campaign presents him as a builder and problem-solver rather than a legislator, and his public message centers on entrepreneurship, small-business costs, economic development, and reconnecting capital investment to community outcomes. Publicly available records reviewed in this pass did not verify a current church affiliation.",
    "theirRecord": "Murray's public record is built around business and development work rather than legislative office. The biggest item attached to his name is the Midtown Station / Indian Springs redevelopment project in Kansas City, Kansas. Research in his file describes the plan as a large-scale redevelopment of the former mall site with multi-family housing, single-family homes, townhomes, affordable housing, childcare, retail, grocery, hotel, and infrastructure components. He also spent years in Oakland, California, where he founded Oak Impact Group, a venture-capital and real-estate investment firm that intersected with social-impact investing and, according to the raw research file, helped bring FDIC-insured real-estate lending into parts of the cannabis industry. That California period is part of his public biography because he now frames his return to Kansas as a homecoming and a reason he sees economic development differently. The most visible controversy in his file came from a late-2025 Disruption Lab podcast appearance that was later highlighted by the Washington Free Beacon. In that appearance, Murray said that spending a decade having lunch with Elaine Brown, a former Black Panther leader, changed \"some wiring\" in his brain. His file also notes an NRSC complaint over missing federal disclosure paperwork and says the Indian Springs redevelopment effort had disputes with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County over the project plan.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Murray has never held public office, so his public record is mostly his business history, development work, campaign messaging, and controversies rather than roll-call votes",
      "The centerpiece of his public biography is Midtown Station, a proposed redevelopment of the former Indian Springs Mall site in Kansas City, Kansas, with housing, retail, childcare, job training, a hotel, a grocery store, and a solar microgrid",
      "KSHB reported in March 2026 that Murray and the Unified Government were still far apart on key terms for the Indian Springs deal, including the land price, the project's financing plan, and whether the developer should pay the government's outside-counsel costs before there was an agreement in principle",
      "Murray spent roughly a decade in Oakland and San Francisco before returning to Kansas in 2023, so both his supporters and his critics treat the California period as a major part of his political story",
      "On a late-November 2025 Disruption Lab podcast appearance, Murray said that spending a decade having lunch with former Black Panther leader Elaine Brown would \"change some wiring in your brain.\" The Washington Free Beacon later used that remark to frame him as aligned with Brown's radical politics",
      "Murray told KSHB that the Indian Springs project had already been revised three times and that delay on the solar component could cost the project about $30 million in federal investment tax credits",
      "His campaign says he wants to lower the costs of starting and running small businesses, use Opportunity Zones, and visit all 105 counties on a \"Heart of America Tour\" across Kansas",
      "Official FEC summary data reviewed in this repo shows Murray raised $124,598.62 from November 23, 2025 through December 31, 2025, spent $15,625.69, and reported $108,972.93 cash on hand with no candidate loans listed in that summary"

She was raised in Arkansas, earned a degree from Lyon College in 2005 and a law degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2011, and moved to Kansas through marriage. Public sources describe her as married to a first-generation immigrant and the mother of two children. Her professional life is immigration law and legal work for families. The public record does not show prior elected office, which makes her Senate bid a first run for office rather than a return to politics. Her campaign leans heavily on her legal background and on the claim that she has seen immigration-system failures up close.",
    "theirRecord": "Parelkar's public record is mainly her legal practice and the way she talks about immigration and children' health coverage. She says the immigration system is confusing and needs reform, and she wants to replace the current patchwork of children's coverage with a single consolidated program. She also pushes stronger antitrust and consumer-protection rules. She attended Marshall town halls and described concerns about transparency and constituent communication as part of what pushed her to run. The public record also shows that she was named in an NRSC complaint over a late personal financial disclosure filing, which is a procedural issue rather than a policy record.",

He is a lawyer, an Associate Teaching Professor of Law at the University of Kansas School of Business, and a consultant whose work is about negotiation and communication analysis. His public biography also includes Harvard Law School and earlier commercial litigation work. McRoberts lives in Lawrence and built his campaign after attending Roger Marshall's town hall in Oakley. He says that event convinced him the district needed another candidate willing to talk about policy, negotiation, and the east-west split in Kansas instead of just repeating partisan talking points. His public material also notes that he teaches business law, business fundamentals, and a course on the origin and spread of conspiracy theories. That combination of legal training, classroom work, and consulting is the clearest way to understand how he presents himself in public life.",
    "theirRecord": "McRoberts does not have a prior elected office record, so his public record is mostly the campaign itself, his university role, and his professional background. He is running as a first-time candidate in a district that has voted Republican for decades, and he has made the case that the race should be about how people communicate and negotiate across regional differences. His campaign launch and later interviews put a lot of weight on that theme. He describes himself as a businessman and negotiator rather than a conventional politician, and he has tied the race to the idea that Kansans in different parts of the 1st District share more in common than national politics suggests. The public record also shows a small federal finance profile. His FEC filing had enough activity to keep the campaign viable, but it remains much smaller than the better-funded statewide and congressional campaigns in the race.",

She has said she was working at the Social Security Administration when the DOGE push to get employees to quit arrived, and she turned that experience into a congressional campaign. She is also a former federal union officer, which gives her a public-service background that is separate from elective politics. The public record describes her as Christian, but I did not verify a specific church or denomination. That is the limit of the accessible record on faith.",

She spent years in legal practice, then moved into federal service, and her campaign now centers on defending government services and the people who use them. Her campaign framing is consistent across the sources: she says the federal government should work for ordinary people, not treat them as a problem to be managed. That is the through-line of her public comments, her campaign launch, and her media appearances. She entered the race after McRoberts and appears to have a lighter campaign infrastructure.

He and his wife Michele live in the Kansas City area, and his campaign and public biography identify him as a Christian. Schwab's public record and campaign messaging both draw heavily on his background as a small-business owner and election administrator. He has spent years in statewide office, which means he is already a familiar figure in Kansas politics rather than a new entrant trying to build a name from scratch.",

His campaign and office biographies say he championed election integrity legislation, including voter ID, and he publicly rejected claims that the 2020 election was stolen. He has also presented himself as someone focused on keeping election authority close to Kansas voters and county election officials. His record also includes several public disputes. Kansas courts and advocacy groups challenged his handling of records requests, and he was tied to the League of Women Voters v. Schwab litigation. He also drew attention in 2024 after USPS ballot-mishandling concerns and has been a prominent conservative voice on abortion and property taxes during the 2026 governor race.",

She was born and raised in Wichita, graduated from KU's School of Pharmacy, and spent decades working as a local pharmacist before moving into statewide politics. She is the first pharmacist to hold statewide elected office in Kansas. Schmidt and her husband Mike have been married for more than 50 years and have two sons and four grandchildren. Her public image emphasizes health care, consumer protection, and competence rather than the kind of combative ideological branding that marks some of the other Republicans in the field.",
    "theirRecord": "As insurance commissioner, Schmidt has been the face of Kansas insurance regulation and consumer complaints. Her office and campaign materials repeatedly point to the money she says has been returned to Kansans, and that consumer-recovery story is central to her pitch for governor. As a state senator, she pushed autism coverage and cancer-care access. In the governor race, she is trying to translate that record into a broader argument that she understands health care, regulation, and the mechanics of statewide administration better than a typical partisan politician.",

      "Schmidt enters the governor race with statewide executive experience already on her résumé",

He has represented Senate District 16 since 2009, and before that he served on the Andover City Council. His public biography also places him in Wichita-area business and civic life, including his role as executive director of GoCreate at Wichita State University. Masterson's family and faith life are part of his public record. The research file identifies NewSpring Church in Wichita as his church, and his campaign biography says his family attends there. He is married and has been a visible figure in Kansas Republican politics for years, especially through legislative leadership.",
    "theirRecord": "Masterson's record is primarily legislative leadership. He has been a central figure in the Kansas Senate, where he has guided Republican priorities on taxes, regulation, education, and social issues. The research file also ties him to a push for judicial selection changes and other structural reforms, which makes his record more about institutional power than about a single signature bill. His campaign materials and public statements are explicit about ideology. He frames himself around conservative identity, faith, and the idea that Kansas government should be more aggressive on security, spending, and cultural issues. That record matters because he is not running as a new face; he is running as one of the people who has already helped set the agenda.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Jeff Colyer is a physician, surgeon, and former governor of Kansas who is running again for governor as a Republican. He grew up in Hays, earned his medical degree and practiced as a surgeon, and has long presented himself as a fifth-generation Kansan with a strong connection to western Kansas. He is married to Ruth Gutierrez Colyer, and the public record reviewed describes him as Roman Catholic. Colyer's background combines medicine, public service, and national policy work. He was a White House Fellow, served in the Kansas Legislature, became lieutenant governor, and then served as governor after Sam Brownback resigned to take a federal post. That history makes him one of the most recognizable people in the field.",
    "theirRecord": "Colyer's state record is built around his time as lieutenant governor and governor, especially KanCare and the budget fights that followed the Brownback era. His supporters point to a budget surplus, school-funding work, and his effort to end long-running school finance litigation. His campaign also leans on his medical background, his humanitarian work as a war-zone surgeon, and his close alignment with Donald Trump. He also carries older political baggage. He lost the 2018 Republican primary by 345 votes after serving as governor, and he stepped away from the 2022 race after a prostate-cancer diagnosis. In the 2026 race, he has made abortion, CRT, property taxes, immigration, and school policy central to his pitch.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Colyer has already served as governor, which gives him a statewide record that none of the other major Republican candidates can match",
      "His public identity combines medicine and politics, and he uses his surgical and humanitarian work as part of his governing story",
      "He was the 47th governor of Kansas for a short period after Brownback resigned",
      "His 2026 campaign is heavily tied to Trump alignment, school policy, and abortion restrictions",
      "The public record reviewed says he is Roman Catholic, but no current church membership page was verified in this pass",
      "His 2025 year-end campaign filing shows $2,070,322.09 raised and $1,884,509.78 cash on hand, making him the best-funded candidate in this group",

He was born in 1982, lives in Johnson County with his wife Jenna Brofsky and their sons Isaac and Aiden, and is publicly identified as Jewish. His education includes Garden City Community College, Washington University in St. Louis, and Georgetown Law. Corson's professional background combines law, economic development, and federal service. He worked as an attorney, served in the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Administration, led the Kansas Democratic Party, and later became a Dole Institute Fellow. That mix gives him a more policy-and-administration-oriented resume than many other candidates in the field.",

His public record and campaign messaging cover schools, lower taxes, rural healthcare, agriculture, and keeping more Kansans in the state by making life more affordable. He also has a real federal and state policy background outside the Legislature. The research file says his campaign is backed by major endorsements from Laura Kelly, Kathleen Sebelius, and Sharice Davids, and that his campaign is built around a moderate, policy-heavy pitch rather than culture-war politics.",

She was born April 26, 1969, grew up in Slater, Missouri, and lives in Overland Park with her husband Greg and their three children. She earned degrees from the University of Missouri in journalism, marketing, and political science, and the research file describes her as the first college graduate in her family. Before entering the legislature, Holscher worked in business and communications, including time at R.H. Donnelley, Add Sheet, and Sprint. Her public biography also centers on family economics and school advocacy, which has become a major part of her campaign identity.",
    "theirRecord": "Holscher served in the Kansas House from 2017 to 2020 and has served in the Kansas Senate since 2021. She co-founded the Women's Bipartisan Caucus and has been one of the more visible Democratic voices on public schools, Medicaid expansion, reproductive rights, and opposition to school vouchers. Her legislative story is tied to the Brownback tax era and the effort to reverse it. The research file says she was part of the coalition that moved Kansas away from the Brownback tax cuts and that she has repeatedly framed public education and health care as state priorities. In the governor race, that record is the foundation for her argument that Kansas needs a more policy-driven Democratic leader.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [

      "Her record is strongest on school funding, Medicaid expansion, and opposition to vouchers",
      "She has been a visible critic of the Brownback tax legacy and a supporter of reversing it",
      "Her 2025 year-end report shows $397,952.07 raised, $218,060.34 spent, and $179,891.73 cash on hand",

The public material reviewed shows a candidate running on plain-language themes such as public schools, health and fitness, economics, and personal freedoms, with a style that is much more campaign-driven than institutional.

    "whoTheyAre": "Charlotte O'Hara is a Republican candidate for governor from Overland Park. She was raised on a farm in Bourbon County, graduated from the University of Kansas, spent more than 20 years as a general contractor, and later co-owned a manufacturing company in Olathe with two of her sons. She is the mother of five and grandmother of seven. O'Hara's public record also includes local and state office. She served in the Kansas House and later on the Johnson County Commission, and the research file describes her as a familiar conservative voice in Johnson County politics. Her campaign materials and public columns lean heavily on tax, spending, and cultural issues.",
    "theirRecord": "O'Hara's record includes a term on the Johnson County Commission, service in the Kansas House, and a long run as a conservative commentator. During COVID, she publicly opposed masks, vaccines, and shutdowns while serving on the county commission. She also wrote columns that argued for lower taxes, smaller government, and more conservative policy positions. In the 2026 governor race, she has continued to run as a hard-right Republican with a clear anti-spending and anti-regulatory message. The research file says she has attacked government waste, DEI, CRT, STAR bond tax incentives, and what she sees as overly broad public spending. She lost the 2024 governor race in her earlier run for office, but she remains visible in the field because of her long record in Kansas Republican politics.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "O'Hara has real governing experience from both the Kansas House and the Johnson County Commission",
      "She is one of the most ideologically conservative candidates in the governor field",

      "She has used faith language in her campaign, but I did not verify a current church affiliation in the public material reviewed",
      "Her 2025 year-end filing shows $589,550.97 raised, $78,652.57 spent, and $510,898.40 cash on hand",
      "The filing includes $193,000 in self-funding, so personal money is a meaningful part of her campaign",

The research file describes her as a school board member and businesswoman who has three sons, including two children with learning challenges, which has shaped how she talks about schools and family policy. She is a first-time statewide candidate and built her campaign around a plainspoken style rather than a long political record. Her public launch materials emphasize that she was the first candidate to declare and file. The campaign presents her as someone trying to bring a business-owner's mindset to state government, with a focus on direct language and low-drama politics.",
    "theirRecord": "Rogers does not have a legislative voting record, so the public record is mostly campaign positioning and prior local civic work. The research file says she has leaned on business experience and school board work, with her campaign arguing that Kansas needs less political theater and more practical management. Because she is new to statewide politics, there are fewer formal public actions to review than for the senator and statewide officeholders in the field. Her campaign materials and filings make the clearest case for how she would govern: conservative, business-oriented, and focused on family and school policy.",

She describes herself as a conservative Christian and says she is a faithful member of River Community Church. The public record ties that church to her campaign identity more directly than it does for most statewide candidates in the race. Her school-board background matters because it is the clearest public office she has held. The school-closure period during COVID gave her a platform to talk about reopening schools, data, and family decision-making.",
    "theirRecord": "Eakins's public record is mostly local and educational rather than legislative. She served on the Wichita Board of Education and used her data-analytics background to argue that schools could reopen safely during the pandemic. Her campaign materials present that experience as practical rather than ideological: she argues that data, family priorities, and school outcomes should drive policy. She also built a campaign site around the \"Kansas comeback\" brand, which frames her as a statewide conservative candidate with a business and education background. The public finance record shows that her campaign is large and heavily self-funded. That matters because it shows she is operating at the scale of a serious statewide campaign, not a symbolic entry.",

He is married to Heidi, and his campaign materials present him as a Christian and as someone rooted in family and business rather than elected office. His campaign materials stress business experience, faith, and a desire to challenge the existing Republican political class. Sarnecki has not held statewide office, so his public case rests on private-sector biography rather than a legislative record.",

His public record is mainly business, media, and campaign work, including 513 Films, which the research file describes as a faith-based film company, and his public profile as an owner and operator rather than a career officeholder. The campaign messaging also links him closely to conservative Christian identity and to pro-Trump politics. Because he has not served in elected office, the main record to evaluate is his business history and how he presents that history on the campaign trail. The available material shows a candidate trying to convert private-sector credibility into political support, while giving voters very little history of how he would govern inside state government.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Kris Kobach is Kansas Attorney General and a Republican candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial race. He is a Topeka-raised lawyer with Harvard, Oxford, and Yale credentials who built his public identity around immigration law, election law, and conservative legal fights. He lives near Lecompton with his wife Heather and their five children. His name has been part of Kansas politics for years. Before becoming attorney general in 2023, Kobach served as Kansas secretary of state from 2011 to 2019, where he became one of the state GOP's most polarizing figures. His public record and campaign messaging still revolve around the same themes: elections, immigration, federal litigation, and court selection.",
    "theirRecord": "As attorney general, Kobach has used the office for aggressive conservative litigation. His campaign bio says he has brought or joined suits against OSHA over vaccine mandates, DHS on behalf of ICE agents and sheriffs, and the Air Force on behalf of pilots facing religious-belief penalties. He has also used the office to keep Kansas in the center of national fights over state authority and federal policy. His earlier tenure as secretary of state remains a major part of his public record. That chapter includes voter-roll fights, proof-of-citizenship litigation, and the election-law controversies that made him a national figure. His 2022 Senate campaign ethics penalty for We Build the Wall-related violations is still part of the public story, and his current gubernatorial messaging continues to lean into election and court reform.",

      "Kobach is Kansas attorney general and a former secretary of state, so his public record spans both statewide law enforcement and election administration",
      "His work in office has centered on immigration cases, election-law fights, and the push to change how Kansas selects Supreme Court justices",
      "His 2025 state filing showed $337,330.24 raised and $502,626 cash on hand",

    "whoTheyAre": "Pat Proctor is a retired Army colonel, Leavenworth Republican, business owner, and Kansas House member running for Secretary of State in 2026. His public biography says he served 25 years in the Army, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and later built a Kansas political career that combines military service, business ownership, and legislative work. He and his wife Aree co-own Baan Thai Restaurant, and he has represented Leavenworth in the Kansas House since 2020. He chairs the House Elections Committee and has made election security the center of his statewide campaign.",
    "theirRecord": "Proctor's record is built around elections, security, and administrative order. In the House, he has been one of the strongest advocates for tighter election rules, including citizenship verification, ballot deadlines, and paper audit measures. He presents that as a way to protect confidence in the system rather than as a partisan stunt. The rest of his public identity is just as structured. The Army service gives him a national-security frame, the restaurant gives him a small-business frame, and the legislature gives him a policymaker frame. That combination is why his campaign reads less like an outsider bid and more like a conventional conservative promotion into statewide office.",

He comes out of the High Plains agricultural world rather than a big-city political machine, and his public identity is tied to farming, ranching, local institutions, and a long Kansas civic footprint. Rahjes is from Agra, where he was raised on a family farm and ranch and still lives. He and his wife Lori are members of the United Presbyterian Church in Phillipsburg, and his campaign message leans on the kind of rural conservatism that is familiar in western Kansas: trust, stewardship, and practical systems.",
    "theirRecord": "Rahjes has spent the last decade in the Kansas House representing the 110th District. His public record is anchored in agriculture, rural infrastructure, budget work, and water issues, which means he has spent most of his legislative life on the subjects that matter most to western Kansas communities. For Secretary of State, he is running on a straightforward premise: make elections trusted and business filings simple, and keep government from getting in the way. He presents that pitch in a more measured tone than some of the louder statewide candidates, which is part of why he reads as a conventional rural Republican rather than a hardline disruptor.",

She is a Pepperdine graduate, entrepreneur, and former state representative whose case for the office rests on business experience and direct experience working elections. Her campaign materials say she spent 16 years in technology, real estate, and finance, built a small real-estate investment firm, founded an interior design company, volunteered with the League of Women Voters, and worked seven years as an election worker before serving in the Legislature. Those are the core facts she uses to argue that the secretary of state's office should be run as an administrative office rather than as a culture-war platform.",
    "theirRecord": "Day served in the Kansas House from 2020 to 2021. The Legislature's archive ties her to bills and votes on concealed carry in the Capitol, the death penalty, World War II funeral honors, and international relations. It is not a long legislative record, but it is enough to show how she operated when she actually held office. Her current campaign argues that the office has two practical jobs: run elections and manage business filings. On her campaign site, she says Kansans deserve elections that are accurate, reliable, and free from political influence, disinformation, and fearmongering, and she pairs that with a promise to streamline registration and business-formation processes. That puts her in direct contrast with candidates who mainly frame the office around election-fraud politics.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Barb Wasinger is the Republican state representative for Kansas House District 111 in Hays. Before the Legislature, she served eight years on the Hays City Commission, including two terms as mayor, and six years as an Ellis County commissioner. Her public biography is tied closely to Hays and to local Catholic life. The record identifies her as an active member of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Hays, where she serves as a lector and as an notable Minister of Holy Communion. Her public materials also note a theology concentration from St. Catherine University. Wasinger has represented District 111 since 2019. Her public role is built on long local-government service rather than on a statewide or national political profile.",
    "theirRecord": "In Topeka, Wasinger chairs the General Government Budget Committee and works on administrative rules. That gives her real procedural leverage, even though she is not one of the most visible members of the House. Her public record in Hays is strongly tied to local infrastructure, especially the R9 Ranch water work that has been central to Hays's long-term water planning. She has also spoken publicly about taxes, education, and the idea that her job is to work through issues instead of just talking about them. The accessible record shows a legislator who is locally rooted, committee-active, and publicly comfortable with Catholic language in her own political speech.",

He also created a youth advisory board for Hays High and TMP-Marian students so they could advise the city commission directly.

    "whoTheyAre": "Shaun Musil is a longtime Hays city commissioner and former mayor who has spent more than a decade in city government. He works as an account representative for Nex-Tech and has lived in Hays for roughly 30 years. In local reporting, he comes across as a steady, low-key official whose public identity is tied to city operations more than partisan branding. Musil and his wife Heather co-owned the Paisley Pear Wine Bar, Bistro and Market in downtown Hays until they sold it in 2024. He also served as mayor during the COVID period, which put him at the center of one of the city's most difficult public-health and ordinance debates. His public record shows a person who has stayed in Hays for the long haul and built his civic reputation around practical city management.",
    "theirRecord": "Musil's record is dominated by the R9 water project and the broader question of how Hays grows without breaking its utility system. In his candidate Q&A and election coverage, he repeatedly described the water project as unfinished business and a generational necessity. He also framed retail growth and a stronger sales-tax base as part of the city's financial stability. He has backed housing policy changes, including RHID and other adjustments that he says have helped new houses get built. Public coverage also shows him treating sustainability and city services as linked questions rather than separate fights. That makes him one of the more policy-oriented commissioners on the board, even if he does not talk like a national politician.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Musil has been on the commission long enough to shape the city's water, housing, and retail debates over multiple election cycles",
      "He treats the R9 water project as the main unfinished task facing Hays, not as a side issue",
      "He has said Hays needs retail growth and a stronger sales-tax base to stay financially healthy",
      "His wife Heather's work in education and their former Paisley Pear ownership give him a visible downtown connection, but his public record is still centered on city government",
      "He was mayor during the COVID era, voted for the mask ordinance, and later said his family faced vandalism and threats because of that decision",
      "No major public ethics complaint or scandal surfaced in the reviewed sources"

    "whoTheyAre": "Sandy Jacobs is a Hays city commissioner, former mayor, and retired banker who has spent years in local public life. The public record describes her as a native Hays resident who moved from banking into city government and now serves as one of the commission's more experienced members. Her biography is rooted in local continuity rather than a big political brand. Jacobs' background is in finance and nonprofit work. She retired from Sunflower Bank after serving as executive vice president and later led the Heartland Community Foundation before retiring from that role in 2020. On the commission, she is known for a calm, collaborative style and for treating infrastructure and budgeting as long-term stewardship tasks.",
    "theirRecord": "Jacobs' record is closely tied to the R9 water project, housing, park spending, and the city's budget process. She has supported the city through repeated water discussions and has treated the pipeline issue as a core long-term responsibility rather than a one-off capital item. She was elected mayor before the 2026 reorganization, when the commission chose Mason Ruder as mayor and Alaina Cunningham as vice mayor. Her public comments also show a willingness to defend revenue-neutral budgeting and a conservative tax posture while still supporting city investment in key infrastructure and development work.",

      "Jacobs is one of the city's longest-serving and most experienced elected officials",

    "whoTheyAre": "David Vilaysing is a Hays city commissioner, retired Hays police sergeant, and owner of DXI Training Solutions. He has 19 years with the Hays Police Department plus military police experience, and local reporting describes him as someone who moved from frontline public safety into training and civic leadership. He is one of the newer elected faces on the commission, but his public-service background is substantial. Vilaysing's company provides de-escalation, tactical communication, self-defense, and first-responder training. He is also active in the wider training community through ILEETA. His public image is rooted in law enforcement, practical safety work, and a desire to stay connected to the Hays community after leaving the police department.",
    "theirRecord": "Vilaysing was elected to the Hays City Commission in 2025 on a platform about water, housing, and transparency. His first set of public comments and questions as a commissioner were about the R9 water process, city operations, and the cost of ordinary city services such as pet licensing. He has also pushed practical questions about city costs, including pet licensing and whether the program is worth its annual expense. That kind of detail-oriented, operational approach fits his background in policing and training more than a traditional political profile.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Vilaysing entered office with 22 years of combined law-enforcement and military-police experience",
      "He runs a training company, not a political consulting operation",
      "His public questions as a commissioner have been about water, housing, city transparency, pet licensing costs, and basic city operations",
      "He was elected in 2025, so his city-government record is still early",
      "He has no major public controversy in the source set I reviewed",
      "His commission style reads as practical and operational rather than ideological"

He helped steer the city through repeated legal and policy battles over the transfer and has been the staff voice explaining why Hays treats water as a generational issue.

The record ties him to St. Nicholas of Myra Catholic Church in Hays through parish council leadership and Knights of Columbus involvement, and the public material makes clear that this is a visible part of his public life.

He has been one of the clearest voices in the county's jail-expansion discussion, arguing that the existing facility is not enough for the county's needs. He has also spoken publicly about ICE detainers and county limits. The record shows him explaining what the sheriff's office can and cannot do, rather than presenting county authority as broader than it is. His office record is reinforced by the annual workload statistics in the raw material, which show the kind of transport, security, and call volume the sheriff's office handles in a typical year.",

The Hays civic record presents him as a hometown prosecutor who came back to serve.",

He has said that the Legislature, not the county attorney, decides what is criminal, and he has applied that logic to marijuana and hemp-derived Delta-8 and Delta-10 cases. That is a concrete policy choice, not a rhetorical one, and it shows how he understands the office. His office also handles the full weight of rural county prosecution: misdemeanors, felonies, juvenile matters, alcohol and drug care cases, child-in-need-of-care cases, and mental-illness related work. The raw file makes clear that Cunningham is managing a backlogged office with limited attorney capacity while trying to keep victims informed and cases prioritized.

    "whoTheyAre": "Bobbi L. Dreiling is the Ellis County Clerk and Election Officer. She won reelection in 2024 with 9,971 votes and serves as the county's top election administrator. The public record shows an ordinary Kansas county-office path: Hutchinson Community College, eight years as deputy clerk under Donna Maskus, then election to the clerk's office in 2020. Dreiling's job is not flashy, but it matters. She handles elections, tax-roll certification, commission minutes, and other county administrative work that shapes how the county operates. Her public reputation is built more on process and election administration than on ideology.",
    "theirRecord": "Dreiling's defining public issue has been election administration, especially the Fort Hays State polling-location fight. She closed the 601 Main site for low turnout and ADA reasons, combined precincts, and defended the decision with the number of registered campus voters she saw in the record. That made her a central figure in a very local but very visible access-versus-cost dispute. She also pushed procedural changes in the clerk's office. Her tenure includes revenue-neutral-rate mailings, election security cameras, Saturday early voting, and a notification system for voters. The one blemish in the record is the misprinted-ballots episode from her deputy-clerk years, but her later work shows a clerk tightening systems rather than improvising around them.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Dreiling is one of the few county officials whose entire public identity is tied to election administration",
      "She had eight years inside the clerk's office before taking the top job",
      "She won reelection comfortably in 2024 even after the campus polling-place fight",
      "Her office has pushed practical election changes like cameras, notifications, and early voting",
      "Public materials show very little about her personal life, which makes the office itself the main story",
      "I did not find a full donor ledger, but one county-committee expenditure tied to her race did surface in the public record"

He is a farmer and vice president of L5 Farms, with operations in Ellis and Rush counties and a long local agriculture background. The public record places him squarely inside the Hays-area farm and county-government world. Leiker graduated from TMP-Marian in 2004 and appears in the county's broader Catholic-heritage network, although I did not find a direct personal statement confirming parish membership. His public life is built around agriculture, county budgeting, and the practical math of running a farm in western Kansas.",
    "theirRecord": "Leiker has been one of the more fiscally conservative county commissioners, but his record is not just about saying no to spending. He supported the 2026 budget increase while arguing the county needed to justify each line item, and he framed mental-health funding as cheaper than building a larger jail. He also backed the Big Creek Estates housing approvals and said the county should work with the city of Hays on water and job growth. He has served on the county zoning board, the Kansas Hereford Association board, and other local bodies, which reinforces the sense that his county work is tied to the region's farm economy and land-use decisions.",

      "Leiker is a working farmer who moved into county government from the agricultural economy",
      "He is the vice chair of the Ellis County Commission in 2026",

      "He has been explicit that water, housing, and jobs are linked local issues",
      "Public coverage focuses more on his budget votes, farm background, and county infrastructure decisions than on personal biography",

He is an electrician and plumber by trade, and the public record consistently presents him as a working county resident rather than a polished political operator. He won his seat in 2020 and is now in his second term. Younger's public biography is modest, and that is part of the point. He comes out of construction and trades, has a very limited digital footprint, and talks about county government in practical language. In a county where infrastructure, water, and budgets matter every year, that is a recognizable kind of officeholder.",
    "theirRecord": "Younger campaigned on the county spending too much money, but once in office he supported the 2026 budget increase because he thought mental-health funding was cheaper than building a jail. That combination of skepticism and pragmatism shows up repeatedly in his record. He has also been a steady voice on water, housing, and county-city coordination. He backed Big Creek Estates discussions, pushed for proactive economic development, and said the county should work with the city of Hays to get more water and higher-paying jobs. His record is policy-focused rather than personality-driven.",

The office matters, even if the person holding it is intentionally low-profile.",

The 2024 election result page confirms that she won the office countywide, and the county office page shows the service mission of the position.

He is one of the county’s more administrative officeholders. His biography also sits inside the Ruder family network that runs through Hays government. He is married to Ruth Ruder, sits in the same family orbit as Mayor Mason Ruder, and his public background is heavily shaped by Catholic schooling and Catholic-work connections in Hays. Even when the specific parish is not named, the family and school trail is strong.",
    "theirRecord": "Ruder’s clearest office action was the decision to add a $2.50 fee for walk-in motor-vehicle transactions. He said the fee was allowed by state law, helped fund the office, and reduced pressure on property taxpayers. The office also modernized its queue flow and customer handling, which makes the record more than just a fee hike. He says the fee raised more than $50,000 annually and helped reduce the treasury budget from $452,000 to $367,000. That is the kind of practical county-office result that matters to taxpayers even if it never becomes a big public fight.",

He is a parish council member at Our Lady, Help of Christians Catholic Church in Antonino, and the sources also tie him to a long family life in Hays, five children, and a long-running role in local school and youth activities.",

He has argued for a 10-year facilities plan instead of a shorter horizon, pushed for evening meetings and public video access so more residents can watch school-board business, and pressed the district to treat bond and naming-rights dollars with a long-term replacement-reserve mindset. He also took clear public positions on several concrete disputes. He voted against the Hays High/Roosevelt construction contract after saying board members had not had enough opportunity to review it. He voted against hiring Superintendent Ron Wilson's wife Andrea through the consent agenda and pushed for closer review of the district's nepotism policy. He also pulled the Golden Belt Bank naming-rights deal from the agenda because he thought the price and terms were too weak and that other businesses should be able to compete for the opportunity.",

That means the Ruder family occupies elected roles across county, city, and school government.",

He and his wife Emily moved back to Hays in 2015. Yarmer’s public identity is medical and local. He is the only physician on this part of the board, and he speaks from the perspective of a parent with children in USD 489 schools. His biography is easy to verify because it runs through Albert, Otis-Bison, FHSU, KU, UMKC, and HaysMed.",

He has also been the board member most willing to draw a hard line on parental rights. During emergency policy revisions, he said he did not think parents give up their rights between 8 and 3, and he has generally framed classroom decisions through the lens of core academics and fiscal restraint.",

That is why he appears in this project at all: his decisions shape the environment every school-board candidate talks about. His public biography is more administrative than personal. I found the office, the district, and the facilities work much more clearly than I found any private background.",
    "theirRecord": "Wilson's record is the bond era itself. He has been the superintendent while the district built a new Hays High School, renovated Roosevelt Elementary, and continued managing the long-term consequences of those projects. He has also been public about the district's facilities needs. In one Hays Post opinion piece he said the district needed to stop settling for outdated schools, and in another story he said the baseball stadium would go from the district's best facility to its worst if the system did not keep investing. The more controversial part of his record came during the 2022 bond election, when he emailed district staff about vote turnout and later drew a public scrutiny report over that message. Even so, the public record still treats him mainly as the person who executes board decisions and keeps the district moving.",
