  // Article body
  whoTheyAre: `Tracey Robert Mann, born December 17, 1976, is a fifth-generation Kansas farmer from Quinter who became a commercial real estate broker in Salina before entering politics. He grew up on the family's Gove County farm — an operation still active today — and attended Kansas State University, earning a B.S. in Business Administration before returning to western Kansas to work the land and build a real estate career.

Mann first entered public life when he won a seat in the Kansas Senate in 2009, representing Senate District 36. After a narrow loss in the 2010 Republican primary for the KS-01 congressional seat, he returned to private business for nearly a decade. He re-entered the congressional race in 2020, won the Republican primary, and defeated Democrat Kali Barnett in the general election with 67% of the vote. He has since been re-elected in 2022 and 2024 by similar margins, cementing KS-01 as among the most reliably Republican districts in the nation.

Before entering Congress, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values — a Washington-based faith leadership program. He and his wife Audra have four children and live in Quinter. His congressional biography foregrounds his farming identity and stated commitment to rural Kansas values.`,

  theirRecord: `Mann serves on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His tenure has centered on four areas: agricultural policy, including the Farm Bill and crop insurance programs; border security legislation; energy production and opposition to green energy mandates; and fiscal conservatism, including opposition to large spending packages. Heritage Action rates him at 96%, placing him among the most conservative members of the House.

On January 6–7, 2021, Mann voted to object to certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes, citing "election integrity" concerns. This vote placed him among the 147 House Republicans who maintained their objections even after the Capitol breach earlier that day. Mann has defended the vote in subsequent constituent communications, framing it as responding to voter concerns rather than endorsing the attack.

Mann also voted against the bipartisan ROTOR Act — legislation that would have expanded drone delivery infrastructure in rural areas. The bill had support from agricultural organizations and rural broadband advocates, and its failure drew criticism from rural development groups. Mann has not offered detailed public comment on the vote.

Key legislation Mann has supported includes the Secure the Border Act, the REIN IN Inflation Act, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and the Energy Independence and Security Act. He has consistently voted against large omnibus spending packages and opposed expanded federal social programs.`,

  whatYouShouldKnow: [
    "Voted against certifying Arizona AND Pennsylvania's electoral votes on January 6, 2021 — one of 147 House Republicans to do so after the Capitol breach that same day.",
    "The only member of the Kansas congressional delegation to vote against the ROTOR Act, bipartisan legislation that would have expanded drone delivery routes in rural and agricultural communities.",
    "56.71% of his campaign funding comes from PACs — with only 0.72% from small-dollar donors (under $200). The majority of his individual grassroots support comes from larger donors.",
    "His single largest donor category is the Crop Production industry ($197,200), representing large agricultural input corporations — chemical, seed, and fertilizer companies — rather than individual family farmers.",
    "He served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values prior to Congress — a faith-based leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C.",
  ],

  whereTheyWorship: `Mann attends First Covenant Church in Salina, Kansas, affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church denomination — a theologically centrist Protestant tradition with roots in Swedish pietism. Before his congressional career, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values, a Washington-based nonprofit that runs faith-oriented leadership programs for high school and college students. His public statements frequently invoke faith as a personal anchor, though he does not typically make church policy a campaign centerpiece.`,

In a state that last elected a Democratic senator in 1932, praising a former Black Panther leader as a personal inspiration is disqualifying with the general electorate. It may not even play well in a Democratic primary where electability is the paramount concern",

A KCK native with legitimate deep roots (Sumner Academy multigenerational), elite real estate credentials (CCIM/SIOR), and a nearly $1 billion redevelopment project in his hometown. But the decade in Oakland, the cannabis industry work, and especially the Elaine Brown quote create a massive vulnerability in Kansas. He's essentially running on the narrative that leaving Kansas and coming back made him better -- a risky pitch in a state that values people who stayed.

He is running a \"businessman, not politician\" campaign in a district where that frame has appeal. His weakness is that he lives in Lawrence, has no roots in western Kansas, and is running in a district where a Democrat hasn't won since 1952. The Cook PVI of R+16 means he would need roughly a 16-point swing from the national environment to even be competitive, which is historically unprecedented for this district",

    "campaignWebsite": "https://scottschwab.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Scott Joseph Schwab was born July 9, 1972, in Great Bend, Kansas — a small agricultural city in the heart of the state. He grew up there and attended Fort Hays State University in Hays, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1994. After college he went to work for the Kansas Farm Bureau as a career agent, then moved into pharmaceutical sales and sales training at PMSI-Tmesys, a Fortune 50 company, from 1999 to 2005. He later served as a regional sales manager and eventually Executive Vice President at CompDME, a durable medical equipment company in the Kansas City metro area. He also earned selection as a Rodel Fellow through the Aspen Institute, a competitive civic leadership program for emerging politicians from both parties.

Schwab entered the Kansas House of Representatives in 2003, representing District 49 in the Olathe and Shawnee area of Johnson County. He left in 2006 to run for the Republican nomination in Kansas’s 3rd Congressional District but finished second in that primary with 32.5% of the vote, behind banker Chuck Ahner. He returned to the House in 2009 and served continuously until 2019 — seven total terms. He rose to Speaker Pro Tempore from 2017 to 2019 and chaired the Elections Committee for roughly four years. He won the Secretary of State’s office in 2018 with 50.6% of the vote and was re-elected in 2022. In 2023 he served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, the fifth Kansan to hold that position. He announced his candidacy for governor in January 2025.

Schwab is married to Michele. Together they have four sons: Nathan, Caleb (deceased), Alex, and Isaac. He has spoken about them publicly: "When my kids were born, Nathan was my pleasure, Caleb was my joy, Alex was my delight and Isaac was my treasure." In August 2016, ten-year-old Caleb was killed on the Verruckt waterslide at Schlitterbahn Kansas City when the raft went airborne and he struck a metal support structure. Schwab spoke at the funeral, addressed his son’s friends, and later credited his church community and his faith for helping the family survive. The family reached a $19.7 million wrongful death settlement in January 2017 — reported to be the largest for a minor in Kansas history. In March 2025, Schwab announced he had been diagnosed with Stage 1 lung cancer after a routine screening found a nodule; surgery removed it and doctors said no further treatment was needed. He continued his campaign through recovery.`,

    "theirRecord": `As Elections Committee chairman in the Kansas House, Schwab championed the Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act, which required voter photo ID in Kansas — signed into law in 2011. That bill became one of the most-cited pieces of state election legislation in the country and established his identity as an election-law conservative. As Secretary of State beginning in 2019, he consistently maintained that Kansas elections were secure, fair, and accurate — a position that put him directly at odds with President Trump’s fraud claims after the 2020 election. The Kansas Reflector headlined its November 2020 coverage of him: "As other Republicans lied about voter fraud, Kansas’ secretary of state was a voice of sanity." His exact quote: "Was there organized, rigged fraud that changed the outcome of the election? I have seen no evidence of that." In 2022 he won a Republican primary against conspiracy-aligned challenger Mike Brown 55% to 45%.

Schwab’s Secretary of State record also includes notable controversies. In 2020 he directed a private software company to disable a feature that gave his office easy access to provisional ballot data — effectively blocking a public records request filed by voting rights advocate Davis Hammet. A Kansas Court of Appeals three-judge panel unanimously ruled in July 2022 that this violated the Kansas Open Records Act. The ruling stated that his action — "choosing to conceal rather than reveal public records" — was unlawful. After the ruling Schwab still delayed providing the records. He was also named in a lawsuit from the League of Women Voters over 2021 voting laws that tightened signature match requirements and criminalized some voter registration activities. That case produced a split outcome at the Kansas Supreme Court.

On the governor’s campaign trail, Schwab has made property tax reduction his centerpiece issue, criticizing the 2025 Legislature and Governor Laura Kelly for delivering what he called "a paltry $25.88 property tax break for the owner of a $150,000 home." He supports banning China from buying land near military bases, has aligned with Trump on voter roll maintenance using the federal SAVE database — earning personal praise from the president — and opposes abortion, believing personhood begins at implantation. He loaned his campaign $1.045 million of his own money in 2025, confirming millionaire status, and raised approximately $1.42 million total through year-end 2025.`,

      "As Secretary of State he publicly rejected Trump’s 2020 election fraud claims — ‘I have seen no evidence of that’ — a rare move for a Kansas Republican at the time",
      "A Kansas Court of Appeals unanimously ruled in 2022 that Schwab violated the Kansas Open Records Act by directing a company to disable software that gave his office access to provisional ballot data",

    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Scott Schwab and his family are active members of LifeMission Church in Olathe, Kansas — a non-denominational Christian congregation led by Pastor Clint Sprague, located at 16111 S Lone Elm Rd. The church was founded in 2002 as a Bible study in Pastor Clint and Mary Sprague’s home. When ten-year-old Caleb Schwab was killed at Schlitterbahn in August 2016, Pastor Sprague served as the family’s public spokesman from the moment the tragedy unfolded, calling Caleb "an incredible young man" who "lit up a room." Caleb’s visitation and funeral service were held at LifeMission Church on August 11–12, 2016. The family had attended church there that same Sunday morning before driving to the waterpark. Schwab has spoken openly about how his faith and his church community carried the family through the loss. In a 2018 FOX4 interview he said: "God is real, and he’s been very real to me. Palpable. To my wife and to our kids, too." His campaign explicitly ties his Christian identity to his public service: "I’m Scott Schwab, a proud son of Great Bend, a Christian, a father, a believer in the American dream."`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Vicki L. Schmidt was born September 15, 1955, in Wichita, Kansas, and grew up there alongside her future husband Mike, whose family lived just two blocks away. They both attended Wichita South High School, went on to the University of Kansas together, and married in 1974. Vicki earned her pharmacy degree from KU's School of Pharmacy in 1978 — and has described herself as a pharmacist for over 40 years. She and Mike have two sons, four grandchildren, and have lived in Topeka for more than 40 years. Dr. Michael J. Schmidt is an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Kansas Orthopedic Society.

Schmidt's pharmacy career shaped her approach to public service. As a state employee working on the Kansas Medical Assistance Program, she discovered errors in the Medicaid drug rebate program that were costing the state millions. She implemented a fix that resulted in more than $391 million in recouped dollars. She helped get funding for KU's School of Pharmacy to move into a new building and expand its doctoral program. In 2019, KU awarded her its Distinguished Service Award — the pharmacy school's highest honor. In 2018, when she was elected Kansas Insurance Commissioner, she became the first pharmacist in Kansas history to hold statewide office — and is reportedly the only elected pharmacist in statewide office in the United States. In May 2023, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went public intentionally — "It's humbling" — underwent surgery and radiation, and was declared cancer-free in September 2023. She said she was aware of at least two women who scheduled mammograms after her announcement and were themselves diagnosed with cancer as a result.

Schmidt ran for governor in July 2025, announcing through a lighthearted video where people in grocery stores, churches, and pickleball courts kept asking if she was running. Her campaign slogan is "It's time Kansans have a governor that works as hard as they do." She raised approximately $980,000 through 2025 — with a modest $81,500 personal loan compared to self-funded rivals — and claims the distinction of the most donor-funded campaign in the GOP primary field, with 800+ individual contributors and 57% of donations from Kansans.`,

    "theirRecord": `Schmidt served in the Kansas Senate from 2005 to 2019, representing District 20 (Shawnee and Wabaunsee counties). She was Assistant Majority Leader from 2009 to 2012 and from 2017 to 2019, and chaired the Public Health and Welfare Committee for six years. She survived the 2012 Brownback "purge" of moderate Republicans — Koch Industries and the Kansas Chamber recruited a challenger against her, and she won her primary by just 160 votes out of 11,000 cast. She later described her 2012 vote for the Brownback income tax cuts — which became the "Kansas experiment" and ultimately cratered state revenues — as one she deeply regrets: "I sincerely regret that I trusted the process to move that along, but I will tell you that I learned a big lesson that day. You can't always trust the process."

Her most notable legislative distinction is being the only Republican in the Kansas Senate to vote against both major anti-abortion bills of her era. She voted against a 2011 bill blocking taxpayer-funded abortions. She voted against the 2015 "Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act" — Kansas was the first state to pass such a ban, and the vote was 31–9; Schmidt was the lone Republican "no." Kansans for Life PAC responded to her governor announcement with a formal statement calling her record "the worst on life of any Republican to ever seek office in Kansas." On her current position: "Like most Kansans, I don't believe in abortion on demand, like some of the far left do. But I do believe in reasonable exceptions." She also fought for and helped pass autism insurance coverage for children under 12 (HB 2744, effective 2014) and helped seed funding for the KU Cancer Center's NCI designation.

As Insurance Commissioner since 2019, Schmidt has recovered more than $202.7 million for Kansas consumers through disputes with insurance companies. She earned the highest vote percentage of any statewide candidate in both 2018 and 2022, winning all four congressional districts in 2022 including one that elected a Democrat. In early 2026, she championed Senate Bill 409, which would have eliminated out-of-pocket costs for follow-up breast imaging — connecting her personal cancer experience to advocacy. The bill died in committee. Democrats and reporters characterized the failure as political retaliation by Senate President Ty Masterson, who controls the legislative calendar and is running against Schmidt in the same primary. Masterson's camp said politics had nothing to do with the bill's failure.`,

    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Born September 15, 1955, in Wichita; pharmacist for 40+ years; KU pharmacy school Distinguished Service Award recipient",
      "Married Mike Schmidt in 1974 — over 50 years together — after meeting at Wichita South High School; two sons, four grandchildren",
      "Diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2023; declared cancer-free in September 2023 after surgery and radiation; used the experience to advocate for SB 409 requiring zero-cost follow-up breast imaging",
      "The only Republican in the Kansas Senate to vote against both the 2011 taxpayer-funded abortion ban and the 2015 Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act",
      "Kansans for Life PAC formally called her record 'the worst on life of any Republican to ever seek office in Kansas'",
      "Recovered $202.7 million for Kansas consumers as Insurance Commissioner (2019–present)",
      "Earned the highest vote percentage of any statewide Kansas candidate in both 2018 and 2022 — won all four congressional districts in 2022",
      "Was the first pharmacist ever to hold statewide office in Kansas, and is reportedly the only elected pharmacist in statewide office in the country",
      "Boycotted the January 2026 GOP debate because the Republican Party charged candidates $10,000 to participate — stated: 'Under this agreement, the party picks winners and losers'",
      "Her church affiliation has not been publicly identified, though her campaign announcement video includes a scene at church and her biography references upbringing focused on 'hard work, honesty, and faith'"
    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Vicki Schmidt has not publicly identified her specific church or denomination in campaign materials or interviews. Her campaign announcement video (July 9, 2025) includes a scene at church, and her official biography states she and husband Mike shared upbringings "focused on hard work, honesty, and faith." She references faith as a background value rather than a centerpiece of her public identity. Given her 40+ years in Topeka and her moderate Kansas Republican background, she likely attends a mainline Protestant church, but that has not been confirmed in available public sources.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Ty Marlo Masterson was born September 23, 1969, in El Dorado, Kansas, in Butler County, and grew up in the Wichita area. He attended Kansas State University and went into small business — owning a construction company, working in real estate, and serving on the Andover City Council before running for the Kansas House in 2004. He represents Senate District 16 in the Andover/Sedgwick County area and has been a state senator since 2009. He and his wife Marlo have been married for more than 30 years and have six children: Kaely, Mendy, TJ, Abby, Marshal, and Kenzy — plus five grandchildren. Alongside his legislative work, Masterson has served for roughly a decade as Executive Director of GoCreate, a Koch Industries–funded 18,000-square-foot makerspace at Wichita State University that offers manufacturing tools, equipment, and training. He takes unpaid leave during legislative sessions, though a Democratic colleague proposed eliminating state funding for the GoCreate director position in 2026, arguing Masterson was "drawing two taxpayer-funded salaries."

Masterson became Kansas Senate President in January 2021, elected unanimously by Republican colleagues. He founded the Truth Caucus in 2017, a conservative bloc of over 60 House and Senate legislators, and served as the 2024 National Chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the influential conservative policy organization. His campaign network includes a 501(c)(4) dark money nonprofit called Take Back Kansas, created by Trump 2024 campaign operatives — Chris Grant of MAGA Inc., pollster-partner David Lee, and data consultant Tim Saler. The group entered 2026 with $700,000 in its account. Masterson announced his governor's candidacy July 20, 2025, with the slogan "Let's Take Back Kansas," saying: "Tangling with Laura Kelly these last few years has taught me I can only do so much from the position I'm in."

In 2010 or 2011, Masterson filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy with approximately $885,000 in unsecured debts — the result of his construction company's failure and losses in real estate and commercial ventures. The filing occurred while he was serving on the Kansas Senate Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the state budget. He attributed the bankruptcy to banks that "decided to no longer work with me." The filing was first publicly reported in December 2012.`,

    "theirRecord": `Masterson's tenure as Senate President has been defined by his confrontations with Democratic Governor Laura Kelly and his role driving the Kansas Republican supermajority's legislative agenda. He pushed a flat income tax bill (SB 169) proposing a 4.75% rate for all Kansans, overrode the governor's veto on a transgender sports ban in 2023 (House 84–40, Senate 28–12), led the override of the gender-affirming care ban for minors in 2025, and in March 2026 led the override of both the bathroom bill (SB 244) and the pregnancy center CARE Act. After the health care sharing ministries tax bill override on March 27, 2026, Masterson walked to the ceremonial bell outside the House chamber and rang it. Democrats called it gloating and demanded a point of order; Masterson posted on X: "We won for lower healthcare costs. We will ring that bell every time we put more money back in Kansans' pockets."

Masterson has been a consistent and personal opponent of marijuana legalization in Kansas. Despite polling showing 70% of Kansans support medical cannabis, he has personally ensured marijuana legislation never reaches the Senate floor. He warned that legalization could fuel "gang activity," dismissed supportive polling by saying "they don't know what they're actually saying yes to," and opposed Medicaid expansion by calling it an expansion of "the welfare state." He championed the cell phone ban in schools (SB 302, "Bell to Bell, No Cell," signed into law March 2026) and led redistricting efforts in fall 2025 designed to disadvantage Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids. He also created the Committee on Government Efficiency (COGE) modeled on federal DOGE, but that committee restricted 1,500+ public submissions until after the session — which legal experts said violated the Kansas Open Records Act.

He has not been without controversy in his own party. When Charlotte O'Hara attacked him at the January 2026 debate for being too friendly with Democrats, he gestured at fellow Republican candidates and said: "This is not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy." He also told Hugh Hewitt in December 2025 that the Kansas Reflector was "a kind of a Soros-funded blog that masquerades as the news" — a claim the Reflector's editor denied and its opinion editor mocked in a satirical column comparing Masterson to a raccoon that drank peanut butter whiskey.`,

    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Ty Masterson attends NewSpring Church in Wichita, Kansas — a contemporary, non-denominational evangelical congregation. He has publicly stated "I'm a follower of Jesus Christ" and explicitly connects his faith to his legislative priorities. His pro-life position is framed around the conviction that "every life is precious, created by God." His legislative agenda on pregnancy centers, gender-affirming care, bathroom policy, and health care sharing ministries all reflect conservative Christian values. He does not compartmentalize faith from governance. NewSpring Church maintains a presence on Instagram, X, and Facebook under @newspringkansas and has a podcast on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Jeff Colyer was born June 3, 1960, in Hays, Kansas — making him the only Kansas governor ever from Hays. His father, James Daniel Colyer DDS, was a World War II Navy veteran who survived the invasion of Peleliu, graduated from Fort Hays State University and Creighton dental school, and practiced dentistry in Hays for 30 years (1955–1985). The Colyer family belonged to St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Hays and kept a small farm outside town where they raised Pony of the Americas horses and showed them at the Kansas State Fair. Jeff attended Thomas More Prep-Marian, the Catholic high school in Hays, graduating in 1978. He has said that TMP shaped the direction of his life. His mother's battle with breast cancer was an early influence on his decision to pursue medicine.

Colyer earned a BA in Economics from Georgetown University in 1981, then an MA in International Relations from Clare Hall at Cambridge University in 1982. Before medical school he worked as an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, co-authoring multiple editions of The Military Balance — the world's leading annual assessment of global military capabilities. He earned his MD from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 1986 and completed residency and fellowship training in craniofacial and plastic surgery. From 1988 to 1989 he served as a White House Fellow under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, focused on international affairs. He opened his private plastic and craniofacial surgery practice in Overland Park in 1994 and has operated on more than 20,000 patients. He married Ruth Gutierrez in 1991; she was alongside him in Rwanda and has her own extraordinary resume in oncology research, genetic therapy, and consulting. They have three daughters: Alexandra, Serena, and Dominique.

No other candidate in this governor's race — and few in any American political race — can match Colyer's humanitarian record. Over 35+ years with the International Medical Corps, beginning with a 1985 mission into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan, he has volunteered as a surgeon in active war zones across more than 20 countries. The defining mission came in 1994: Colyer was the only surgeon in all of southern Rwanda while 800,000 people were being murdered in the genocide. His wife Ruth served alongside him. He performed reconstructive surgery on trauma victims and trained local medical personnel under dire conditions. Most recently, in 2024, he spent a month at Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro, Ukraine, treating Russian war casualties and describing the injuries as "in a category far above what we're seeing in other conflicts." He has lectured on his firsthand experiences at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.`,

    "theirRecord": `Colyer entered the Kansas House in 2007, was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2009, and was selected as Sam Brownback's running mate in 2010. He served as the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 2011 to 2018. His signature achievement in that role was designing KanCare, Kansas's privatized Medicaid system, which he claims saved $2–2.5 billion since 2013 while increasing services, reducing inpatient hospital stays by 23%, and increasing primary care use by 24% — all without cutting provider payments. He also oversaw a $500 million increase in public school funding over five years to address Kansas Supreme Court rulings on inadequate education financing.

When Brownback resigned in January 2018 to become Trump's Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Colyer was sworn in as the 47th Governor of Kansas the same day. He inherited a $500 million deficit with $876 cash in the checking account and left office 11 months later with an $800 million surplus — without raising taxes. He made his first executive order a mandatory annual sexual harassment training policy for all 20,000 executive branch employees, the first such mandatory policy in Kansas gubernatorial history. He also signed Senate Bill 284 protecting faith-based adoption agencies that decline to place children in LGBTQ+ homes, stating: "Catholic Charities and other adoption agencies are key to the fabric of our communities." In August 2018 he ran for a full term as governor in the Republican primary — and lost to Secretary of State Kris Kobach by approximately 345 votes out of 313,000 cast. Trump had endorsed Kobach. Colyer conceded graciously without requesting a recount. Kobach subsequently lost the general election to Democrat Laura Kelly.

Colyer entered the 2022 race, earned an endorsement from Sen. Roger Marshall and signed up Mary Eisenhower (granddaughter of President Eisenhower) as campaign treasurer — then withdrew on August 30, 2021, after announcing a prostate cancer diagnosis, the same disease that had afflicted both his father and grandfather. He underwent treatment, recovered, endorsed Trump for president in a Newsweek column in November 2023, served as Trump's 2024 Kansas Campaign Chairman, and formally launched his third run for governor on May 14, 2025. He raised approximately $2.07 million through 2025, including $1.05 million in personal loans, giving him the largest war chest in the Republican field.`,

    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Jeff Colyer was raised in a Catholic family in Hays, Kansas. His family attended St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Hays, confirmed through his father's obituary. He attended Thomas More Prep-Marian, a Catholic high school in Hays, which he has credited with shaping his life direction. His father's funeral was held with a rosary, a funeral Mass at St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in Leawood, and burial at Resurrection Catholic Cemetery in Lenexa — all Catholic rites. Colyer signed Senate Bill 284 as governor specifically protecting Catholic Charities and other faith-based adoption agencies. His current specific church has not been publicly confirmed in available sources, though his humanitarian service through the International Medical Corps, his consistent pro-life positions, and his Catholic schooling all point to a faith that shapes his actions more than his public statements.`,

      "Corson is one of the most institutionally connected Democrats in the race",

      "The campaign home page surfaces an active social feed and policy-heavy messaging",
      "His official Senate committee work and Dole Institute fellowship remain part of his public brand",
      "His prior work at the Kansas Democratic Party and Commerce Department provides a notable executive/government background",
      "Ethan Corson goes to church. The Sunday school reference is specific and personal -- this is not a politician saying \"I'm a person of faith.\" He is describing a weekly family routine of church attendance with his kids. \"Making pancakes with the boys before Sunday school\" is a lived detail, not a talking point. However, the specific church and denomination were not identified. The \"Pastor Dallas\" reference and the Black History Month church visit suggest he may attend a mainline Protestant or multicultural congregation. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Corson is the strongest Democratic candidate by every measurable metric: money, endorsements, and institutional support. His \"common sense, common ground\" messaging is designed to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents in a red state. His Jewish faith is notable in a heavily Christian state -- he does not appear to foreground it. His labor law background and union representation work will be a double-edged sword: appeals to working families but provides ammunition for Republican attacks. His time at the Kansas Democratic Party gives him deep institutional knowledge of the state's political machinery. The 8,000-mile crisscross of Kansas shows a serious effort to compete in rural areas, which is the Democratic Party's greatest weakness in the state"

      "Her campaign has more social footprint than many people in the field, including Facebook, Instagram, and X",
      "Kansas political coverage has also tied her to statewide fights over education and, in 2025, the insurance-commissioner race",
      "The UU church and Episcopal church appearances appear to be campaign events held at church facilities, not indicators of personal membership. Many candidates use church halls as community meeting spaces. No personal faith identity found. In a Democratic primary, candidates are less likely to lead with faith credentials. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Holscher has the most compelling personal narrative in the Democratic field -- granddaughter of tenant farmers, daughter of a construction worker and school custodian, first-generation college graduate, single mom who worked her way up through Sprint. Her legislative record is genuinely bipartisan, and her 9 years in the statehouse give her more governing experience than Corson. But the Kelly-endorsed Corson has outflanked her on money and endorsements. Her school voucher critique is razor-sharp and resonates in rural Kansas where there simply are no private schools. Her silence on faith is notable -- in Kansas politics, that is a gap that opponents will exploit. The pressure campaign story is politically damaging to the Democratic establishment more than to Holscher herself"

However, his candidacy is interesting because he breaks the Democratic mold on transgender athletes -- a position that could theoretically appeal to moderate Kansas voters but will alienate the progressive base. His \"obesity as a statewide health crisis\" framing is unique in this race. His background as a personal trainer/gym owner/fitness author gives him a distinctive profile, though the 2003 legal troubles with Total Fitness Athletic Center are a potential vulnerability that opponents could exploit. He has virtually no fundraising apparatus and no institutional support. His debate participation gives him a platform but not a realistic shot at winning",

    "theirRecord": "O'Hara says that during COVID she refused masks and vaccines and opposed school and business closures while serving on the Johnson County Commission.\n\nShe also served in the Kansas House and as a Republican district chairwoman and precinct committeewoman.\n\nHer public brand is centered on life, property rights, education, election integrity, and free-market politics.\n\nThe campaign site presents her as a contractor, homeschool parent, and business owner, which is a stronger image than a typical one-page political landing page.",

      "Her campaign language is unusually explicit about opposition to masking, vaccines, and shutdowns",
      "The campaign site also emphasizes her role on the Johnson County Commission and Kansas House",
      "O'Hara is a populist firebrand who will not win the nomination but will make noise. Her combative style already cost her the Johnson County Commissioner seat in 2024, and Masterson publicly called out her approach as damaging to Republican general election prospects. Her anti-STAR bond position on the Chiefs/Royals stadium deal is actually popular with fiscal conservatives, and her \"DOGE must come to Kansas\" messaging taps into the current national mood. But at 75 with a recent electoral loss by 7 points in her own district, she lacks the credibility and resources to compete. Her prolific column-writing is both her greatest asset (transparency) and greatest liability (ammunition for opponents). She is a spoiler candidate who could pull votes from the right flank",

Kansas First.\" and repeatedly emphasizes plainspoken, low-drama politics.\n\nThe public record in this sweep did not surface a substantial elected-office history, which makes her biography more entrepreneurial and campaign-driven than legislative.\n\nFull Name: Stacy Rogers (nee Hepner).",
    "theirRecord": "I did not find a prior legislative voting record for Rogers in public state records reviewed here.\n\nThe most notable public action in the record is her early filing and the way she positioned herself as the first candidate to declare and file.\n\nNo major court, disciplinary, or governmental controversy surfaced in this pass.\n\nDay One Executive Order: \"Go through each Department with a fine tooth comb, root out inefficiencies, mishandling and fraud.",

Her early declaration and first-to-file status show ambition, but her fundraising is essentially nonexistent compared to the major candidates. Her \"first female Republican governor\" angle is noteworthy but insufficient without serious money. Her platform is standard conservative (government efficiency, property taxes, pro-life) without a distinctive breakthrough message. The Kids Closet national franchise business is actually a more impressive credential than it initially appears -- running a national franchise system requires real organizational skill. But without a fundraising breakthrough, she is a long-shot candidate",

      "Eakins is a serious person with a serious resume -- Bell Labs, Lucent, Avaya, founding a successful data firm, chairing the Wichita Chamber. Her Theological Studies background and company name \"Cornerstone\" suggest a faith-rooted worldview without being heavy-handed. But her campaign is almost entirely self-funded ($1M personal loan out of $1.14M total), which raises questions about grassroots support. Her explicit Trump alignment (\"golden age\") may help in a Republican primary but could be a liability in the general. Her school board experience (won by just 46 votes, chose not to run for re-election) is thin public service experience. Her \"medical freedom\" messaging is coded anti-vaccine/anti-mandate language from the COVID era. At the debate, she positioned herself as an outsider alongside Sarnecki against the establishment candidates",

    "occupation": "Attorney, Owner of Mann Law Firm, P.A. (est. 2016/2017)",
    "born": "$50.00",
    "hometown": "Not publicly specified; his father was a police officer, and Chris followed in his footsteps. He attended the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS",

    "campaignWebsite": "https://chrismannforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Chris Mann grew up watching his father leave for work every day as a police officer. He chose the same path. In 1998, while still a junior at the University of Kansas, he became one of the youngest officers in the Lawrence Police Department at age 21. Three years later, his career ended in a moment. On January 11, 2002, at approximately 3:30 in the morning, Mann had pulled over a vehicle for a broken taillight. An intoxicated driver slammed into his parked patrol cruiser at 50 miles per hour. The force threw Mann into the back of the SUV he had pulled over and deposited him 30 feet away on the side of the road. The crash caused severe injuries and he was forced to retire from the force at roughly age 25. He spent years in intensive physical therapy recovering.

Rather than stepping away from public service, Mann decided to keep fighting crime from the courtroom. He enrolled at Washburn University School of Law on a full-ride Koch Public Service Scholarship, designed for students planning to enter public affairs, and graduated around 2010. He prosecuted hundreds of cases — including murder, robbery, and drug offenses — as an Assistant District Attorney in Wyandotte County from 2011 to 2013. From 2013 to 2017 he served as Senior Staff Attorney and Special Prosecutor at the Kansas Office of the Securities Commissioner, handling complex white-collar securities fraud and protecting elderly Kansans from scam artists. He opened the Mann Law Firm in Lawrence in 2016 or 2017, concentrating on DUI defense and criminal cases for clients who cannot afford attorneys. He describes the decision to serve underserved Kansans as "answering the call of his faith."

Mann is married to Ashley Mann, a cardiothoracic surgeon practicing in the Topeka or Olathe area, who supported his decision to open the firm. They have two children — daughter Skylar (approximately 10) and son William (approximately 6) — and live in Lawrence. Mann became deeply involved with Mothers Against Drunk Driving after his accident: he served as Kansas Advisory Board Chair in 2011, joined the national board in 2014, and became national board chair until 2020. He advocated for Kansas legislation requiring ignition interlock devices for DUI offenders. In 2022 he challenged Kris Kobach for Attorney General — his first run for elected office — and lost by just 1.6 percentage points, the closest statewide race in Kansas that cycle. He outraised Kobach nearly 2:1 ($950,000 to $465,000). He is running again in 2026 and by end of 2025 had raised approximately $537,000 — more than double his fundraising pace from the equivalent period in the 2022 cycle.`,

    "theirRecord": `Mann has never held elected office. His record is built from law enforcement, prosecution, and advocacy work. As an Assistant DA in Wyandotte County, he prosecuted hundreds of criminal cases across multiple categories. As a Special Prosecutor at the Kansas Securities Commissioner's office, he put away white-collar fraudsters who had stolen life savings from elderly Kansans. As national chairman of MADD, he represented one of America's most recognized victim-advocacy organizations and championed state-level legislation requiring breathalyzer-connected ignition locks for convicted drunk drivers. His supporters — including the Democratic Attorneys General Association, Kansas NEA, UAW, Kansas AFL-CIO, and a bipartisan group of 140+ Republican, Democratic, and Independent attorneys who wrote that "Kris Kobach is not a good attorney" — endorsed him in 2022.

In the 2022 campaign, Mann won Johnson County (Kansas City suburbs), Douglas County (Lawrence, his home), Shawnee County (Topeka), Riley County (Manhattan), and Lyon County (Emporia) — five of 105 Kansas counties. He came within 1,800 votes of flipping Sedgwick County (Wichita, the second-most populous). He lost because straight-ticket Republican voting in rural Kansas overwhelmed his urban and suburban margins. His 2026 campaign frames the race as "law enforcement vs. politician" and explicitly targets Kobach's record of using the AG office for political purposes — suing over immigration, transgender athletes, and other culture-war causes — rather than core public safety functions.

Mann's policy platform emphasizes fentanyl trafficking, drug distribution networks, retail crime, and white-collar fraud as priorities. He supports women's right to make private medical decisions and has stated he will not use AG office resources to attack constitutional rights — a direct reference to the 2022 Value Them Both referendum that rejected abortion restrictions by 18 points. He owns guns and supports the Second Amendment while believing violent offenders should not have access to firearms. On marijuana he personally believes in well-regulated medical cannabis but says he will enforce current law. He supports ending dark money in Kansas elections and strengthening open records laws. He has raised 89% of his 2026 contributions from Kansas donors.`,

    "campaignWebsite": "https://www.jocoelection.org/candidates-elected-officials/pat-proctor",
    "whoTheyAre": `Pat Proctor, PhD, is a retired U.S. Army Colonel who served 25 years on active duty before entering Kansas politics. He earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 1994, then spent a quarter century in the Army, deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq, serving as operations officer in Tikrit, and finishing his career as a Battalion Commander in Jordan. Along the way he earned three master's degrees — from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the School of Advanced Military Studies, and the U.S. Army War College — and a doctorate in History from Kansas State University in 2014. He lives in historic Leavenworth, Kansas, just outside the gates of Fort Leavenworth, with his wife Aree.

After retiring from the Army, Proctor moved into academia. He taught at Benedictine College and is currently an Assistant Professor in the Homeland Security Program at Wichita State University's School of Criminal Justice. He has published four books, including works on the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Vietnam War, and the end of combat operations in Iraq. His academic articles have appeared in The Historian, Parameters, Military Review, and other peer-reviewed journals. He was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 2020, representing District 41 in Leavenworth, and became chairman of the House Elections Committee.

Proctor was the first Republican to formally declare for the 2026 Kansas Secretary of State race, announcing his candidacy in April 2025. He frames his campaign around the slogan "Restoring Confidence in Our Elections, Growing Our Economy" and presents his military background as proof he has "defended democracy" and is uniquely qualified to protect Kansas elections. His campaign had raised approximately $312,000 as of January 2026, including a $134,000 personal loan, giving him a commanding fundraising advantage over his primary opponent Ken Rahjes.`,

    "theirRecord": `As chairman of the House Elections Committee, Proctor has been among the most aggressive legislators in the country on election restrictions. In the 2025–2026 session he authored or advanced a package of bills that significantly tightened Kansas voting rules. HB 2437, which passed the House 80–43, deputizes the Secretary of State to cross-reference voter rolls against the federal SAVE database twice a year, restricts voter registration websites to .gov domains, and requires counties to remove voters from rolls when funeral homes publish obituaries. HB 2569 would eliminate no-excuse mail-in voting entirely if any Kansas judge invalidates the state's ballot signature verification law. HB 2491, which passed 87–37, requires that personal information for non-citizens receiving public benefits be shared with the Secretary of State's office.

A private Zoom recording from February 2024 — leaked in February 2025 by Loud Light Civic Action — showed Proctor telling Johnson County Republicans: "If it was up to me, Election Day would be Election Day," indicating he would prefer to eliminate advanced and early voting entirely. He also vowed to "ram through" legislation to eliminate the three-day post-election grace period for mail-in ballots — and that grace period was indeed eliminated by subsequent legislation. When Kansas Reflector reporters asked Proctor to clarify contradictory statements about his "axis of ballot harvesting" phrase, he responded: "You are a partisan hack and your so-called 'newspaper' is a woke, leftist propaganda rag." He repeated that characterization on a second occasion.

Proctor's campaign platform asserts that "voter confidence that the results of our elections reflect their will is at the core of our form of government and our way of life" and promises to make Kansas "the gold-standard for safe and secure elections." He positions his military service as evidence of integrity and patriotism. Critics — including the Kansas Reflector and voting rights groups — argue his legislation would make it harder for Kansas citizens to vote, particularly those who rely on mail-in ballots and early voting.`,

      "Currently an Assistant Professor at Wichita State University's School of Criminal Justice",

    "whereTheyWorship": `No public church affiliation has been confirmed for Pat Proctor in available sources. His military and academic background dominate his public identity. His campaign materials reference his service and his commitment to democracy but do not foreground church membership or faith practices. He lives in the Leavenworth area, which has a variety of military-community churches, but his specific congregation has not been publicly identified.`,

    "theirRecord": "She serves in the Kansas House and has been tied to administrative rules, tax, and state spending debates.\n\nLocal coverage and legislative coffee appearances show her as a regular Hays-area political organizer and explainer of Topeka activity.\n\nShe has been a visible supporter of conservative cultural positions, including public comments that frame government through Judeo-Christian moral language.\n\nThe Hays Post and KSN election-guide coverage reinforces that she is an active local public figure, not just a Topeka legislator.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Ruder's public biography is unusually local and unusually layered. He grew up in Hays, attended TMP-Marian, and later returned to work in Catholic school advancement after earlier work in county environmental services and local food service management. That mix of nonprofit, school, and city work shows up repeatedly in his public roles and makes him one of the more institutionally embedded figures in Hays.\n\nHis career also maps onto the city's biggest policy fights. He has been one of the most visible commissioners on water supply, housing, downtown placemaking, airport funding, and the city's long-running R9 Ranch project. Public coverage also shows him moving quickly from commissioner to vice mayor and then mayor, which suggests he is both politically ambitious and broadly trusted by the current commission majority.\n\nMason Ruder is the mayor of Hays and a member of the city commission. The city's official commission page lists him as mayor, and Hays Catholic Schools describes him as a 2010 Thomas More Prep-Marian graduate who serves as director of institutional advancement. The public record ties him closely to Hays' Catholic and civic infrastructure, not just municipal politics.\n\nEllis County Environmental Services (~2017-2022, 5 years) -- Rose to Environmental Services Director. Oversaw adoption of county's new Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Regulations. Presented 2021 Solid Waste/Transfer Station Annual Report. Led unified effort to revitalize the Extra Territorial Jurisdiction of the City of Hays for smart growth for the next 50+ years.",

    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "This is as deeply embedded in Catholic life as it gets at the local level. Mason Ruder does not just attend -- he works for the Catholic schools, graduated from the Catholic high school, and is a parish member. His faith is clearly central to his identity and career. Whether he is active in Knights of Columbus (Council #6984 meets at IHM) was not confirmed in public records but would be worth asking directly",
      "Ruder is the youngest and most politically ambitious commissioner. CPM credential, political leadership degree, and advancement director role all suggest a person building toward higher office. His sole \"no\" vote on the mask mandate is notable -- it positions him as the most conservative-leaning commissioner on that issue. The 9/11 editorial through the Kansas Press Association shows he is cultivating a public voice beyond Hays. The Youth Leadership Advisory Board is a genuine legacy initiative",

      "As an appointed manager rather than elected official, Dougherty may deliberately keep personal faith private to maintain professional neutrality. 19+ years in Hays without a single public faith reference is notable but may be by professional design. Less relevant for Elect Righteous since he is not elected",
      "Toby Dougherty is the most powerful person in Hays city government. Commissioners serve 2-4 year terms and rotate through the mayor position; Dougherty has been the constant for 19 years. He runs the daily operations, prepares the budgets, hires the staff, and manages every major project. The R9 water project is his legacy bet -- a $145M infrastructure project that will define whether Hays survives as a viable western Kansas city in the 21st century. His Strong Towns philosophy is intellectually interesting and somewhat at odds with the aggressive growth incentives the commission has been approving (RHIDs, IRBs, Chick-fil-A incentives). His 12-year prior career in transportation before city management gives him infrastructure chops. His KU political science background and CPM credential match Mason Ruder's -- suggesting he may have been a mentor/model for Ruder's career path. 19 years with no significant personal controversies is remarkable for any public official",
      "City of Hays: City Manager's Office",
      "Dougherty is the most consequential unelected official in western Kansas. His 21-year tenure managing a city whose water supply is existentially threatened has made him effectively irreplaceable. The R9 Ranch pipeline is a generational infrastructure project -- $144.9M for a city of 21,000 is extraordinary. His Strong Towns methodology makes him unusually sophisticated for a small-city manager. The cost doubling of the R9 project is his biggest vulnerability, but no one has seriously challenged it because everyone knows the alternative (no water) is unthinkable. His personal privacy is remarkable -- in 21 years, there's essentially nothing public about his personal life",

He is visible in school coverage, county office materials, and Hays Post reporting, which together show a local who left for college and law school and then came back. The county attorney office page now lists him as the officeholder from 2025 onward, and the Hays High Guidon profile captures the career-speaker version of the same story: a student who was active in music and clubs and who later found his lane in advocacy and law.",
    "theirRecord": "Cunningham publicly announced that the office would resume marijuana prosecutions, reversing a prior non-enforcement posture on small possession cases.\n\nHe has said the office must prioritize cases because rural western Kansas has too few qualified attorneys and too many defendants waiting in jail.\n\nThe county’s creation of a Victim/Witness Coordinator position was publicly described by Cunningham as a major help to victim communication and case organization.\n\nCounty office directory and attorney page verify his standing as the county attorney and provide direct office contact information.",

      "Aaron Cunningham is openly and unapologetically Christian in his personal identity. The theological language (\"total sovereignty of God,\" \"salvation and redeeming grace,\" \"fallen individual\") is specifically Reformed Protestant -- this is not generic \"I'm spiritual\" language. This is someone who knows theology. The specific church he attends in Hays was not identified but the theological framework suggests Reformed/Calvinist tradition (could be Presbyterian, Reformed Baptist, or non-denominational Reformed).

      "Dreiling is an election administrator in an era when election administration is intensely politicized. Her refusal to place a polling location at FHSU -- despite formal petitions from students, the ACLU, university administration, and campus police -- is her most controversial decision. The \"69 registered voters on campus\" defense ignores the broader population of students who live off-campus but near FHSU. Her election security camera installation and township consolidation show competent administration. The 3,800 misprinted ballots occurred on her watch as deputy clerk -- not directly her fault, but she was in the office when it happened. Her 77-23% re-election margin in 2024 shows the controversy hasn't cost her Republican voter support"

The additional round of checking did not surface any contradictory identity clues.\n\nBrooks is a long-serving USD 489 board member in Hays and a publicly identified leader in the Celebration Community Church Hays campus children's ministry. That combination of school-board service and church-service visibility makes him easy to distinguish from namesakes.\n\nKen Brooks is a Hays school-board incumbent and the district's current vice president. Public profiles identify him as a loss-control safety specialist at Insurance Planning, a Kiwanis member, and a long-time Hays parent whose three daughters graduated from Hays High.\n\nEmployed for 18+ years (as of 2025 election cycle).",
    "theirRecord": "Brooks' board record still centers on fee reductions, bond support, and a generally pro-administration posture on day-to-day management. In the public questionnaire trail, he has repeatedly argued that the district has been responsible with money and that the board should focus on broad oversight rather than micromanagement. The second-pass review did not uncover major controversies or flipped positions.\n\nThe second-pass review reinforced the same core sources: Hays Post candidate coverage, the USD 489 board portal, KSDE directory listings, and Celebration Community Church materials. I did not find court, property, or business-record material that changed the profile.\n\nBrooks' public record is centered on facilities, fees, and budget stewardship. He supported the 2017 bond, later ran on keeping the current bond work on pace, and said the district has done a good job finding ways to fund immediate facility concerns. In 2025 he said he wanted to keep lowering student enrollment fees, and he defended district budgeting as responsible and trustworthy.\n\nHe also favors a board that governs without micromanaging. In his 2025 Q&A, he said the board should provide oversight while leaving day-to-day operations to administrators and teachers, and he specifically pointed to Superintendent Ron Wilson and the district finance team as people he trusts to answer budget questions. That makes Brooks a pragmatic, systems-and-process board member rather than an ideologue.",

    "whoTheyAre": "The broader record still portrays Vajnar as a district insider with unusually deep institutional memory. He is not only a former teacher but also a current board leader who has remained visible in facility planning, bond follow-through, and public discussion of long-range capital work. The second pass did not surface any contradictory biographical facts.\n\nVajnar is the board president and a long-time USD 489 educator, publicly described as having taught in the district for 31 years. The school-board role, teaching history, and local Catholic reference are enough to distinguish him clearly from any namesake.\n\nCurt Vajnar is the current USD 489 board president, a retired Hays teacher, rancher, and business owner. His public biography says he taught for 31 years in USD 489, won Kansas Teacher of the Year, and has lived in Hays for 35 years.\n\nVajnar taught agriculture education at Hays High School for 31 years. He was named Kansas Teacher of the Year by KNEA -- the youngest teacher to win that honor at the time. He was also the only nationally board-certified agriculture teacher in the state. He had teaching endorsements in Agriculture Education, Biology, Drivers Education, and Administration. He chose never to pursue an administrator role despite holding the certificate. Retired around 2020.",
    "theirRecord": "His public priorities remain facilities completion and long-term planning. He repeatedly argued for a 10-year facilities plan instead of a five-year horizon, framing the issue as business-like stewardship and a way to stretch bond and naming-rights dollars. He appears to be one of the district's key agenda-shapers because he also serves as board president.\n\nThe second-pass sweep kept pointing back to the same core sources: Hays Post profile coverage, the USD 489 board portal, KSDE directory references, and the old Knights of Columbus newsletter mention. I did not find any court, property, or business records that materially changed the profile.\n\nVajnar has been one of the clearest board voices on capital planning. He told Hays Post he wants a 10-year facilities plan because the district has several turf and facility replacements with overlapping warranty cycles. He also wants naming-rights revenue to go back into replacement reserves rather than into the general fund, which is a very specific stewardship philosophy.\n\nHe has been broadly supportive of the bond buildout and says the work should be finished well rather than rushed. In later board coverage he also showed up as a steady vote for operations like transportation leasing and building improvements, and the district directory lists him as board president. He reads as a process-and-maintenance board member, not a culture-war board member.",

    "whoTheyAre": "The public record continues to show Ruder as a practical, community-rooted board member with a finance background. She speaks from the perspective of a taxpayer, employee, and parent of a district student, which gives her board comments a strongly local and operational character. The second-pass review did not uncover any identity conflicts.\n\nRuder is a Hays native, Hays High graduate, and USD 489 board member whose public biography centers on local finance work at Golden Plains Credit Union. That combination makes her identity easy to verify and distinct from any same-name person.\n\nRuth A. Ruder is a Hays-born USD 489 graduate, vice president at Golden Plains Credit Union, and a current USD 489 board member. The district portal lists her as a board member, and her public profile shows deep local roots.\n\nThe Mayor's office (Mason).",
    "theirRecord": "Ruder's record is still defined by caution around land use, support for student-facing purchases, and insistence on fiscal accountability. She has supported technology and classroom-oriented spending while also asking hard questions about whether land transactions or sponsorships create real benefit for the district. Her comments in the land-sale coverage showed a willingness to slow down when public purpose was not clear.\n\nThe second pass reinforced her Hays High and Golden Plains background and the district board portal record. I also checked for additional public-record angles such as property, court, and archived social content, but nothing attributable enough surfaced to change the profile.\n\nRuder's public record on the board emphasizes communication, fiscal discipline, and a willingness to slow down when land use or spending choices could have long-term consequences. In December 2025 she voiced concern that a buyer of district land next to the middle school might simply hold it for a tax deduction rather than use it productively. In other votes, she supported laptop purchases for Hays High and said students should be at the center of the district's decisions.\n\nShe is also a board voice who cares about the district's reputation as a community asset. In her election profile she said USD 489 can be \"the highlight of our community\" and that the district should balance smart growth with fiscal responsibility. Her comments on sponsorships and land sales show a board member who is comfortable asking what the public gets back for a given dollar.",

That full education-and-medical path is public enough to keep him distinct from any same-name physician.\n\nDerek Yarmer is a Hays USD 489 board member and an emergency medicine doctor. His public profile says he was raised in Albert, graduated from FHSU in chemistry, completed KU School of Medicine and UMKC residency training, and moved back to Hays in 2015 with his wife Emily.",
    "theirRecord": "Yarmer's board posture continues to read as skeptical but constructive. He supports school goals, but he repeatedly asks for more explanation when spending or process seems rushed, and he has voted no when he thought a purchase or commitment moved too quickly. His public comments about emergencies, core subjects, and extracurricular balance make him one of the clearest \"process first\" voices on the board.\n\nThe second-pass review continued to emphasize Hays Post profiles, the board portal, and the KSDE directory. I did not find court, property, or business records that added meaningful candidate-specific facts, and I did not find a verified faith source.\n\nYarmer has been one of the more skeptical voices on spending and process. He has said board decisions should be broadcast, agendas should come out earlier, and bond money should be spent responsibly. In 2025 he asked for bids on flooring and asbestos work to come to the board before a vote, saying that if everything is an emergency then nothing is an emergency.\n\nHe has also voted against some expenditures that other members supported, including furniture and other purchases where he wanted the board to be more deliberate. His public posture is not anti-school, but it is strongly pro-oversight. He reads like a board member who wants more explanation, more bidding, and more patience before large commitments.",

He has the kind of institutional memory that comes from having watched the district through multiple staffing, facilities, and enrollment cycles. The additional review did not surface any identity ambiguity.\n\nPark is a retired educator and former Washington Elementary principal who has spent more than three decades inside USD 489. His family-of-educators background and long service history make him easy to verify in the public record.\n\nAllen Park is a retired USD 489 elementary principal, a licensed insurance agent, and a current USD 489 board member. Public profiles say he has worked in USD 489 for 31 years and is now also doing part-time UPS work.\n\nAllen Park served USD 489 for 31 years in multiple roles:.",
    "theirRecord": "Park's record still leans toward bond completion, careful process, and a steady interest in teacher retention and student outcomes. He has supported major facilities work but has also shown he is willing to vote no when he thinks purchases need more scrutiny. He appears to view his role as protecting public money while preserving educational quality.\n\nThe second-pass search kept reinforcing his school-district biography and the public board portal. I did not uncover any court, property, or business records that materially changed the public profile.\n\nPark is one of the clearest supporters of the bond-buildout phase and the district's effort to lower student fees. He told Hays Post that the bond is replacing and repairing facilities, more teachers have been hired, and reduced fees help families in tight times. He also repeatedly says communication and transparency are what build trust with stakeholders.\n\nHis more recent board coverage shows him willing to question spending that he thinks is too fast or too expensive. In 2025 he voted against some furniture purchases, and he has been willing to pause or delay decisions when he wants more review. He is not a reflexive \"yes\" vote; he is a long-term district steward who likes structured process.",

I did not find court, property, or archived social sources that changed the profile in a verifiable way.\n\nGoetz has repeatedly pushed the board toward better communication, clearer discipline policy, and more transparent budget decisions. In 2025 she asked how the 2.5 percent raise figure was calculated, and she pushed the district to clarify handbook discipline rules so families know the consequences. She also supported laptops for Hays High students after hearing from teachers who preferred them.\n\nShe has a visible habit of asking the board to slow down and explain itself.

In later coverage he came back to the board with the same eye toward continuity and student experience.\n\nHe also tends to favor steady, operational problem-solving.

    "whoTheyAre": "The second-pass review confirms Wilson as the public-facing executive behind the district's facilities and operations push. He is not a candidate, but his biography matters because every board member's record is filtered through his implementation work. I did not find contradictory biographical material.\n\nWilson is the USD 489 superintendent and the district's top administrator. The board portal and Kansas Educational Directory both support the identity match.\n\nRon Wilson is the superintendent of Hays USD 489. The district's official board portal lists him as superintendent, and the Kansas Educational Directory confirms the same.\n\nWilson served as superintendent in Herington before being hired by USD 489. The Hays school board voted unanimously to offer him a two-year contract in February 2019. While in Herington, his district was one of nine Kansas districts invited to pilot the Mental Health Intervention Team (MHIT) program in 2018 -- a program he has continued to advocate for in Hays.",
    "theirRecord": "Wilson's public record is about execution: bond rollout, facility planning, staffing, and communicating the district's case for better schools. He regularly frames the district's facilities as something that must be improved rather than merely maintained, and his comments help explain the board's broader capital posture.\n\nThe second pass kept returning to the board portal, KSDE directory listing, Hays Post coverage, and the handbook material already in the file. I did not find any church, property, or court source that changed the public profile.\n\nWilson's record is the bond era itself. He has been the public face of Roosevelt and Hays High construction, the district's capital outlay plan, and the ongoing maintenance work that still has to happen after the ribbon cuttings. He has also spoken out when state or federal decisions threaten district funding, including title grant delays and other budget pressures.\n\nBecause he is the superintendent, the board mostly evaluates him through implementation: facility delivery, staffing, budget management, and communications. The public record shows him as a steady advocate for the district's large capital projects and as the person who keeps those projects moving once the board votes.",
