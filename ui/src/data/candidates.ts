  // Article body
  whoTheyAre: `Tracey Robert Mann, born December 17, 1976, is a fifth-generation Kansas farmer from Quinter who became a commercial real estate broker in Salina before entering politics. He grew up on the family's Gove County farm — an operation still active today — and attended Kansas State University, earning a B.S. in Business Administration before returning to western Kansas to work the land and build a real estate career.

Mann first entered public life when he won a seat in the Kansas Senate in 2009, representing Senate District 36. After a narrow loss in the 2010 Republican primary for the KS-01 congressional seat, he returned to private business for nearly a decade. He re-entered the congressional race in 2020, won the Republican primary, and defeated Democrat Kali Barnett in the general election with 67% of the vote. He has since been re-elected in 2022 and 2024 by similar margins, cementing KS-01 as among the most reliably Republican districts in the nation.

Before entering Congress, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values — a Washington-based faith leadership program. He and his wife Audra have four children and live in Quinter. His congressional biography foregrounds his farming identity and stated commitment to rural Kansas values.`,

  theirRecord: `Mann serves on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His tenure has centered on four areas: agricultural policy, including the Farm Bill and crop insurance programs; border security legislation; energy production and opposition to green energy mandates; and fiscal conservatism, including opposition to large spending packages. Heritage Action rates him at 96%, placing him among the most conservative members of the House.

On January 6–7, 2021, Mann voted to object to certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes, citing "election integrity" concerns. This vote placed him among the 147 House Republicans who maintained their objections even after the Capitol breach earlier that day. Mann has defended the vote in subsequent constituent communications, framing it as responding to voter concerns rather than endorsing the attack.

Mann also voted against the bipartisan ROTOR Act — legislation that would have expanded drone delivery infrastructure in rural areas. The bill had support from agricultural organizations and rural broadband advocates, and its failure drew criticism from rural development groups. Mann has not offered detailed public comment on the vote.

Key legislation Mann has supported includes the Secure the Border Act, the REIN IN Inflation Act, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and the Energy Independence and Security Act. He has consistently voted against large omnibus spending packages and opposed expanded federal social programs.`,

  whatYouShouldKnow: [
    "Voted against certifying Arizona AND Pennsylvania's electoral votes on January 6, 2021 — one of 147 House Republicans to do so after the Capitol breach that same day.",
    "The only member of the Kansas congressional delegation to vote against the ROTOR Act, bipartisan legislation that would have expanded drone delivery routes in rural and agricultural communities.",
    "56.71% of his campaign funding comes from PACs — with only 0.72% from small-dollar donors (under $200). The majority of his individual grassroots support comes from larger donors.",
    "His single largest donor category is the Crop Production industry ($197,200), representing large agricultural input corporations — chemical, seed, and fertilizer companies — rather than individual family farmers.",
    "He served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values prior to Congress — a faith-based leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C.",
  ],

  whereTheyWorship: `Mann attends First Covenant Church in Salina, Kansas, affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church denomination — a theologically centrist Protestant tradition with roots in Swedish pietism. Before his congressional career, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values, a Washington-based nonprofit that runs faith-oriented leadership programs for high school and college students. His public statements frequently invoke faith as a personal anchor, though he does not typically make church policy a campaign centerpiece.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Roger Wayne Marshall was born August 9, 1960, in El Dorado, Butler County, Kansas — a fifth-generation Kansas farm kid who became the first in his family to attend college. He earned an Associate's degree at Butler Community College, then a B.S. in Biochemistry from Kansas State University in 1982 (where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity), then his M.D. from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 1987. He completed his OB/GYN residency at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida, and served as a Captain in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1984 to 1991 — seven years of military service before he ever practiced medicine.

In 1991, Marshall moved to Great Bend, Kansas, where he built a 25-year career as an obstetrician and gynecologist, delivering more than 5,000 babies. He was Chairman of the Board of Great Bend Regional Hospital for 14 years, Vice Chairman of the Board of Farmers Bank and Trust, Rotary International District Governor, and a member of the Kansas Wildlife, Parks and Tourism Commission (appointed by Gov. Sam Brownback in 2012). He was, in every measurable way, the civic pillar of his community long before he ran for Congress.

Marshall accepted Christ as his Lord and Savior at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes event in high school. He has read the Bible every day since age 10. He married Laina Marshall — they have been together for more than 40 years and have four children (Lauren, Victor, Matt, and Cal) and four grandchildren. He entered Congress in 2016 by defeating incumbent Rep. Tim Huelskamp in the Republican primary for Kansas's 1st Congressional District, served two House terms (2017–2021), then won the U.S. Senate seat in 2020 with 53.2% of the vote against Democrat Barbara Bollier. On July 9, 2025, President Trump gave him his "Complete and Total Endorsement" for re-election.`,

    "theirRecord": `Marshall serves on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee (as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry, Natural Resources, and Biotechnology), the Senate Finance Committee, and the Senate HELP Committee (as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security). His 98% alignment with Trump's positions makes him one of the most loyal members of the Senate majority. His Heritage Action lifetime score is 82%, with peak ratings of 94% in the 117th Congress.

On January 6–7, 2021, Marshall was one of only eight Republican senators to vote to object to certifying the electoral votes of both Arizona and Pennsylvania. He called his vote "a decision from my heart" and said he "was concerned then and I still am today that six states broke their own laws or their own constitution." When asked about it later on CNN, he told the interviewer he was "so ready to move on." He voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack on May 28, 2021. In 2019, he participated in the SCIF storming — a group of House Republicans, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, who barged into a confidential impeachment inquiry hearing and brought cell phones into the classified facility.

Marshall's pro-life voting record is 100% — he has voted pro-life on every single recorded vote, earning an A+ from SBA Pro-Life America and a 0% rating from Planned Parenthood. His first bill as a U.S. Senator was pro-life legislation. After Kansas voters defeated the "Value Them Both" abortion amendment in August 2022, he said: "Tonight, we must still go to bed with faith and hope, for tomorrow we must be as dedicated to the sanctity of life." He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest. He voted against the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the gun reform bill passed after the Uvalde massacre — calling its red flag provisions "a gun-grabbing scheme." He voted against the $95 billion Ukraine and Israel foreign aid package in 2024, one of only 15 Republican senators to do so, splitting from Kansas colleague Jerry Moran who voted for the aid. He has acknowledged letting ACA subsidies expire will cause "some people's premiums to go up."`,

      "At his March 1, 2025 Oakley, Kansas town hall, Marshall walked out approximately 20 minutes early as constituents shouted about DOGE cuts, rural healthcare, and veterans. He was called a 'coward' as he departed. His chief of staff blamed 'Democrat operatives that couldn't place Oakley, Kansas on a map.' Local attendees said they were real Republican-leaning constituents, not paid activists.",
      "Marshall owns a $1.2 million home on a bayou with a boat dock in Sarasota, Florida — purchased in June 2019, months before launching his Senate campaign. His official Kansas residence is a 1,120 sq ft cabin on a dirt road. He charged taxpayers more than $4,900 for 7 trips to Sarasota in 2021 alone.",
      "During a January 2022 Senate HELP Committee hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci's hot mic caught him calling Marshall 'What a moron' and 'Jesus Christ' in exasperation. The clip went viral with nearly 3 million views. Marshall's response: 'Calling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn't take away from the facts.'",
      "Voted against the bipartisan gun safety bill passed after the Uvalde school shooting, calling its red flag provisions 'a gun-grabbing scheme that violates the Second Amendment.' Both Kansas senators opposed the bill.",
      "Participated in the 2019 SCIF storming — a group of House Republicans who barged into a classified impeachment inquiry hearing and brought cell phones into the secure facility, a national security concern.",
      "Promoted ivermectin as a COVID treatment and opposed mask mandates, saying 'I'm not convinced the masks really work at all.' Facebook removed one of his COVID posts for misinformation. He personally supports vaccines but aggressively fights mandates.",

      "On CNN in 2025–2026, he admitted live: 'Look, I was wrong,' acknowledging a previous claim about Iran's nuclear timeline was incorrect.",
      "His Heritage Action score dropped significantly — from 94% in the 117th Congress to 82% lifetime — but he remains among the Senate's most conservative members."
    ],
    "whereTheyWorship": `Marshall has been a member of First Christian Church in Great Bend, Kansas — affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination — for more than 25 years. His involvement is not casual: he has served as an Elder, a Deacon, the Board Chairman (twice), and he and his wife Laina taught Sunday school together for over 25 years. The Disciples of Christ tradition emphasizes local church autonomy, the priesthood of all believers, and practical Christian service — values that align with Marshall's "small-town Kansas values" messaging.

Marshall's faith is woven into every dimension of his public life. He states he accepted Christ at a Fellowship of Christian Athletes event in high school and has read the Bible every day since he was 10 years old. He has said: "Every decision I make, I always have to be true to my faith." His first bill as a senator was pro-life legislation. After the Value Them Both abortion amendment failed, he quoted Romans 8:28 from the Senate floor. His faith credentials — elder, deacon, board chair, 25-year Sunday school teacher, daily Bible reader since childhood — are among the most documented and sustained of any candidate in this entire investigation.`,

    "party": "D",
    "position": "U.S. Senate candidate",

    "occupation": "U.S. Senate candidate",
    "hometown": "Wichita, KS",

    "family": "Married with family. Describes himself as a husband and father.",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://hartforsenate.com",
    "whoTheyAre": `Jason Hart spent more than 21 years as a prosecutor — specifically focused on the most difficult work the justice system demands: hunting and convicting child predators. He practiced law early in his career in Dodge City, then moved through the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office and the Kansas Attorney General's Office before joining the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Kansas. There he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for approximately 16 years, serving under both Democratic and Republican-appointed U.S. Attorneys, specializing in child exploitation, child abuse, and child pornography cases. Among the cases he prosecuted: a Kansas man sentenced to 480 months — 40 years — for production of child pornography.

Hart's entry into the 2026 Senate race was sudden, and the party-switch story is impossible to separate from his biography. In February 2026, he registered as a Republican with the intention of primarying U.S. Rep. Ron Estes in the 4th Congressional District. Then his wife told him — in a line that has since been quoted in nearly every profile of him — "I'm not sleeping with a Republican." He also learned his friend Katy Tyndell was planning to run as a Democrat in that same race. So in early March 2026, he quit his job as an AUSA, switched to Democrat, and entered the U.S. Senate race. He described the January 2026 killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis as the catalyzing event that pushed him from law enforcement into politics.

Hart describes himself publicly as "a straight, white, Christian man" — and he uses that description strategically, arguing that he is uniquely positioned to win over disaffected Republicans in deep-red Kansas. He holds a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law. He is from Wichita and describes his decision to run as the product of "prayerful and tearful discussions with my wife and family." He has deliberately chosen not to hire a campaign manager, saying that campaign managers prevent candidates from being their "authentic self."`,

    "theirRecord": `Hart has no prior elected office — his entire public record is prosecutorial. That is both his greatest strength and his most obvious vulnerability. As an AUSA, he cannot point to votes cast or legislation sponsored. What he can point to is 21+ years of federal service prosecuting the worst crimes imaginable against children, conducted with consistency across multiple administrations of both parties. Federal prosecutors serve at the pleasure of the U.S. Attorney, which means Hart's 16 years in the office signal that he was effective enough to be retained across multiple administrations.

His campaign platform is centered on economic populism: opposing current tariff policies (saying "Kansas families are paying the price for unfair tariffs"), wanting corporations to "pay their fair share" and close loopholes, supporting small businesses, and calling for Congressional oversight against what he describes as executive overreach. He has spoken at Kansas Democratic Party forums alongside the other seven Democratic candidates. He is running without a campaign manager and without traditional political infrastructure — a deliberate choice he frames as authenticity but which critics note could also signal organizational inexperience.

The defining political question about Hart is not his record — it is his credibility as a Democrat. He switched from Independent to Republican to Democrat within a single month, and his stated reason for being a Democrat is essentially electability math: Kansas Republicans are in the wilderness, and someone who looks and sounds like them can reach them. That argument has drawn both admiration (pragmatic realism) and skepticism (is he actually a Democrat?) from primary voters.`,

    "born": "Overland Park, Kansas",
    "hometown": "Represents Shawnee and Douglas County (Lawrence/Topeka area)",
    "education": "Born: Overland Park, Kansas",
    "family": "Not detailed",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://patrickforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Patrick Schmidt is a sixth-generation Kansan — his family includes six generations of farmers, miners, and teachers — born in Overland Park and shaped by parents who were both public school teachers. His mother worked a second job in retail; his father did custom harvesting with the family business and later worked as a tutor. This working-class background is a core part of how Schmidt presents himself in a field that includes Ivy League lawyers and corporate executives.

Schmidt graduated from Tufts University in 2013 and was commissioned as a U.S. Navy Intelligence Officer. He served aboard the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), where he worked on the battle group's intelligence team defending U.S. interests from China and Russia in the Pacific. He also served at the Pentagon and as a Fleet Intelligence Watch Officer and targeting analyst with Joint Special Operations Task Force Arabian Peninsula. He was stationed at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C. during the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack — an event he has cited as a defining motivation for his entry into politics.

After transitioning to the Naval Reserve, Schmidt returned to Kansas with his wife Megan Walden and made his first political run in 2022, challenging Republican incumbent Jake LaTurner in the Kansas 2nd Congressional District. He lost, but in 2024 he won a Kansas State Senate seat in District 19 — covering parts of Lawrence and Douglas County — defeating Republican Tyler Wible. He was sworn in January 13, 2025. He is approximately 35 years old, making him one of the youngest candidates in the 2026 Senate field, and is the only Democratic Senate candidate currently holding elected office in Kansas.`,

    "theirRecord": `Schmidt's state senate record is short — he was sworn in January 2025 and filed for the U.S. Senate in February 2026, meaning his state legislative tenure was barely a year before he began his federal campaign. In that time, he made property tax relief his signature issue. He broke with Democratic party lines to support a proposed state constitutional amendment capping annual property value increases for tax purposes, showing a willingness to reach across party lines that mirrors his stated approach. He sponsored SR 1706, a resolution condemning the pardons and commutations of sentences for those involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. He has been active in Senate budget debates and described his approach as "trying to stop bad stuff" while pressing for property tax relief.

Schmidt's broader campaign platform centers on property tax relief, rural healthcare access, public education funding, and veterans' issues. He frames these through his military background — his Navy service gives him a national security credential that is rare in the Democratic primary field, and he presents himself as someone who has already served the country and wants to continue doing so in a different capacity. He has been endorsed through his Kansas Senate Democrats profile and has a verified legislative voting record that none of the other Democratic Senate candidates can match.

The timing question follows Schmidt wherever he goes: he entered the Senate race barely a year into his first state senate term. Critics note that this suggests ambition outpacing his commitment to the office Kansas voters just elected him to hold. Supporters argue it demonstrates urgency and that Schmidt believes he can serve Kansans better in Washington. His answer to this tension will be tested throughout the primary.`,

    "education": "Born: Sedgwick, Kansas",
    "family": "Not detailed in available sources",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://www.christydavisforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Christy Cauble Davis is a fifth-generation Kansan born in Sedgwick, Kansas, who graduated from Sedgwick High School before earning a B.A. from Kansas State University in 1997 and a graduate degree from Wichita State University in 1999. She spent her early career in historic preservation — first as a Preservation Planner for the City of Newton, then as a Preservation Officer for the Kansas Historical Society. These are not glamorous government titles, but they represent a sustained commitment to the kind of rural community work that most candidates only describe in speeches.

In 2013, Davis moved to Chase County in the heart of the Kansas Flint Hills to become Executive Director of Symphony in the Flint Hills, a position she held until 2019. Chase County has a population of approximately 2,800 people — she didn't move there to build a political career; she moved there because the work was there. She and her husband Luke Davis then purchased a historic building in Cottonwood Falls and converted it into an award-winning laundromat called "Clean History," featured in American Coin-Op magazine. They later rehabilitated a historic bank building to create new housing and a bookstore. These are not talking points — they are documented projects in a real rural town where Davis actually lives.

President Biden appointed Davis as USDA Rural Development State Director for Kansas, announced June 23, 2022. In that role, she oversaw more than $1.3 billion in investments across Kansas businesses, infrastructure, housing, and healthcare. She led a nationwide effort to cut federal red tape in rural development programs. She ran for Congress in 2020 and lost the Democratic primary. She entered the 2026 Senate race as its earliest serious Democratic entrant, has prior federal executive experience that none of the other challengers can match, and lives further from the interstate than any of them.`,

    "theirRecord": `Davis's most substantive credential is her tenure as USDA Rural Development State Director for Kansas under the Biden administration. In that role, she managed the disbursement of over $1.3 billion in federal investment across Kansas — funding businesses, infrastructure, housing, and healthcare in rural communities. This is verifiable government work with a paper trail, not a general platform promise. She also chaired the Legislative Chair role for the Kansas Downtown Development Association and served on the Chase County Chamber of Commerce Board.

Her campaign platform centers on expanding rural healthcare access (framing rural hospital closures as a direct result of Medicaid cuts Marshall supported), funding strong public schools, immigration reform that works for agriculture (Kansas has significant agricultural labor needs), and rebuilding economic accountability in Washington. Her core campaign message — "It's time for Kansas to have a Senator who shows up" — is a direct reference to Marshall's Oakley walkout.

The central tension in Davis's candidacy is that her greatest credential is also her greatest liability: she served in the Biden administration. In a state Trump won by 14+ points in 2024, the Biden USDA connection is attack-ad material. Her response is that the work she did — $1.3 billion into rural Kansas — benefited Republican-voting farmers and communities regardless of who was in the White House. Her prior 2020 congressional campaign loss is a data point that cuts both ways: it shows experience, but it also shows a loss.`,

    "campaignWebsite": "https://sandyforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Sandy Spidel Neumann was born near Topeka and grew up in Overland Park in Johnson County. Her origin story has a striking detail: as a high school student, she represented Kansas at Girls Nation — the American Legion's premier civic leadership program for young women — and there, she first declared her dream of one day serving in the U.S. Senate. That was decades before she actually ran. She attended Shawnee Mission North High School and went on to earn a B.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago. She then completed her MBA at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management while working full-time at Ameriprise — one of the more demanding academic accomplishments in the 2026 Senate field.

Spidel Neumann built a 40-year business career culminating in 22 years as an executive at Ameriprise Financial Services, one of the largest financial planning companies in the country. She retired in May 2025 and returned to Kansas in the summer of 2025 — decades after leaving for college and career. She is running for public office for the first time in her life at age approximately 60. Her campaign focuses on economic competence: she argues that a candidate who has actually managed a large financial services organization understands the cost-of-living pressures facing Kansas families better than a career politician.

The personal details in her public biography are sparse beyond the professional record. She was raised by working-class parents who valued "integrity, fairness, and respect for all." No spouse or family details appear in public records. The Girls Nation story is the most humanizing element of her public narrative — a teenager from Johnson County who dreamed of the Senate is now actually running for it. Whether that arc resonates with Kansas voters will depend heavily on whether she can overcome the "carpetbagger" question: she was away from Kansas for most of her adult life and only came back in 2025.`,

    "theirRecord": `Spidel Neumann has no elected record — this is her first run for public office. Her professional record is in the private financial services sector, not government. What she brings is a different kind of credential: 40 years navigating complex financial markets and managing a large financial services enterprise. She argues that this background makes her more qualified to address the cost-of-living crisis than career politicians who have never had to make payroll.

Her campaign platform is built around economic issues with a consumer protection frame: opposing the tariffs that Roger Marshall supported which she says are harmful to Kansas farmers, opposing Medicaid cuts that threaten rural hospitals, lowering costs for families, defending Social Security and Medicare, fighting pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, and protecting access to reproductive healthcare. She has called the Republican budget package "the big abomination of a bill" and said that restoring Medicaid funding "would be a good first step because health care is a significant concern in rural Kansas."

Marshall's Oakley town hall walkout in March 2025 was a direct motivating factor in Spidel Neumann's decision to enter the race. She and several other Democratic candidates have cited it explicitly. Her campaign also flagged that she was under scrutiny from the National Republican Senatorial Committee for allegedly missing a financial disclosure filing deadline — a claim her campaign disputed, attributing delays to complications during a federal government shutdown affecting FEC systems.`,

    "whatYouShouldKnow": [

    "whoTheyAre": `Erik Murray was born at KU Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, and grew up in KCK — attending Sumner Academy of Arts and Science, a magnet high school where his own children now attend. He graduated from the University of Southern California in 2004 with a B.A. in Disease Prevention from USC's Medical School. He then spent 20 years building one of the more unusual real estate careers in the Midwest, earning both the CCIM (Certified Commercial Investment Member) and SIOR (Society of Industrial and Office Realtors) designations in 2009 — credentials that place him in the top 1% of commercial real estate professionals internationally.

Murray left Kansas for California, and his time in Oakland became a defining part of his biography — for better and worse. He founded Oak Impact Group in Oakland in 2016, a venture capital investment firm intersecting real estate and social impact. He was among the first to bring FDIC-insured banking real estate lending into the cannabis industry. During this decade in Oakland, he has said he had lunch with Elaine Brown — the former chairman of the Black Panther Party (1974–1977) — describing it as a transformative experience: "Go spend a decade, you know, having lunch with Elaine Brown, who's one of the original founders of the Black Panther[s]. It'll change some wiring in your brain." The Washington Free Beacon published that quote in a story headlined: "Kansas Senate Candidate Names His Political Inspiration: A Black Panther 'Soldier' Working To Destroy the American 'Empire.'"

Murray returned to Kansas City, Kansas in 2023 with his wife Nicole (whom he met at USC) and their four children, two of whom still attend Sumner Academy. He founded Eastside Innovation LLC in 2023 and began leading the nearly $1 billion redevelopment of the former Indian Springs Mall site in KCK — a project that would create 1,500+ new homes, retail, and a 30-acre solar microgrid. He entered the 2026 Senate race on December 3, 2025, and is running on the argument that his decade in Oakland made him a better advocate for communities left behind by capital — a pitch he is bringing home to Kansas.`,

    "theirRecord": `Murray has no elected record. His entire public record is in private-sector development, venture capital, and community investment. The Indian Springs Mall redevelopment is his central credential: a nearly $1 billion project to transform a shuttered suburban mall into 1,500+ homes, retail space, and a solar energy microgrid in one of the most economically challenged communities in Kansas. That project is ongoing — it is not a completed accomplishment but a work in progress.

His campaign platform is centered on lowering costs for starting and running small businesses, supporting Opportunity Zones (tax incentives for investment in distressed areas), expanding healthcare accessibility, and touring all 105 Kansas counties in what he calls his "Heart of America tour." He entered the race December 3, 2025, and immediately attracted the first major opposition research hit of the Democratic primary cycle: the Washington Free Beacon piece connecting him to Elaine Brown's quotes about dismantling the American "empire."

The Brown quote, in full context, was made on The Disruption Lab podcast in late November 2025 — just days before he entered the Senate race. Murray's campaign framed his Oakland experience as broadening, not radicalizing. Brown's current work is legitimate affordable housing development (79 units of supportive housing in West Oakland). But in a Kansas general election against Roger Marshall, "had lunch with a Black Panther founder" is potentially campaign-ending opposition research. Whether it resonates enough to hurt him in the Democratic primary depends on how aggressively other candidates deploy it.`,

    "campaignWebsite": "https://www.anneforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Anne Lea Parelkar was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and grew up in White Hall, Arkansas, graduating from White Hall High School in 2001. She earned a B.A. in History with a Political Science minor and Secondary Education concentration from Lyon College in Batesville, Arkansas. She then attended the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, graduating in 2011 and passing the Arkansas Bar Exam. She is now licensed in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas, and is a member of AILA — the American Immigration Lawyers Association. She has specialized in immigration law throughout her legal career.

Parelkar moved to Kansas when she married her husband Nikhil Parelkar, and the two have lived in Overland Park since 2017. She is not a Kansas native — in a primary field where "fifth-generation Kansan" and "sixth-generation Kansan" are genuine identity markers, she is a transplant who arrived less than a decade ago. That transplant status is her most significant biographical vulnerability among Kansas voters, but her defenders argue that Kansas's immigrant and international agricultural workforce makes her expertise directly relevant to the state's actual needs.

Her motivation to run is direct: she traveled from Overland Park to western Kansas to attend Roger Marshall's March 2025 town hall — the same confrontational event in Oakley that motivated Colin McRoberts to run — and the experience of watching Marshall walk out on his own constituents drove her to enter the Senate race. She is running for public office for the first time.`,

    "theirRecord": `Parelkar has no elected record. Her entire professional record is in immigration law — 14 years of legal practice working with individuals and families navigating the federal immigration system. That work gives her a forensic understanding of immigration policy that no other candidate in the 2026 Kansas Senate field possesses.

Her signature policy proposal is a single consolidated children's healthcare program replacing the current patchwork of Medicaid, CHIP, and other programs. She argues the system is fragmented, confusing, and leaves children without coverage during transitions between programs. This is the most specific and detailed standalone policy proposal from any Democratic Senate candidate in the race.

On immigration, she occupies a notable position for a Kansas Democrat: she acknowledges "we have a very big problem with immigration in our country right now" while calling for reform that works — not abolition or open borders. Her professional background means she cannot be easily caricatured as naive on the issue. She has spoken at the Kansas Democratic Party candidate forum (March 8, 2026) and was featured in a Kansas Reflector piece and a KMAN Radio interview. The NRSC placed her under scrutiny for allegedly missing a financial disclosure filing deadline, a claim she disputes.`,

    "name": "Michael Soetaert",
    "party": "D",
    "position": "U.S. Senate candidate",
    "electionSlug": "us-senate-2026",
    "incumbent": false,
    "occupation": "City Council Member",
    "hometown": "Wellington, KS (Sumner County -- south-central Kansas)",
    "education": "Not specified in available sources",
    "family": "Not detailed",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://mikeforkansas.my.canva.site",
    "whoTheyAre": `Michael "Mike" Soetaert was born in Wellington, Kansas, a direct descendant of Constant Soetaert — he knew his great-grandfather Charles as a child — and a member of a Wellington family that includes former Wellington Mayor Tony Soetaert. He was given up for adoption at birth (before Roe v. Wade) into what he describes as a "right wing, fundamentalist, Roman Catholic family." His adoptive father was Vice President of Coca-Cola Mid-America and previously part of NASA Mission Control for the first 16 Apollo missions.

Soetaert self-identifies as Christian and grew up in a deeply religious household, but has made a very public evolution away from the Republican and Catholic conservative framework of his upbringing. He now champions LGBTQ+ rights, bodily autonomy, and marriage equality — positions that put him at odds with his adoptive family's values. He is the first openly gay candidate to run for U.S. Senate in Kansas, and this historic distinction is the most significant fact about his 2026 candidacy. He lives in Wellington, owns or has operated an art gallery, and won a Wellington City Council seat in November 2025 with 962 votes — only to resign from that seat after two meetings on December 12, 2025, to run for the Senate.

The pattern of Soetaert's political career is one of persistent ambition without organizational infrastructure. He has run for the Council Grove City Council (2019), U.S. House KS-01 (2020, lost primary), U.S. Senate (2022, lost primary), Kansas State Senate District 32 (2024, lost), President of the United States (2024, did not advance), Wellington City Council (2025, won), and now U.S. Senate again (2026). He resigned the one office he ever won after two meetings. He maintains at least four different campaign website domains. He is a perennial candidate whose historic significance as the first openly gay Kansas Senate candidate cannot be separated from his serial campaign record.`,

    "theirRecord": `Soetaert's legislative record is effectively zero. The only public office he has ever held — a Wellington City Council seat won in November 2025 — he resigned from after two meetings, on December 12, 2025, accepted by the council 5-0. Jerry Elmore Jr. was appointed to fill his seat. Before running for U.S. Senate again, he ran for it once before (2022, lost primary), ran for the U.S. House (2020, lost primary), ran for Kansas State Senate (2024, lost), and ran a brief presidential campaign (2024). His public policy record is entirely campaign platform — there are no votes, no sponsored legislation, no committee assignments to examine.

His current platform centers on LGBTQ+ rights (supports the Equality Act and the Respect for Marriage Act), bodily autonomy, and consumer protection. He changed his position on abortion after Kansas voters supported abortion rights in the 2022 referendum, saying "Kansans voted for bodily autonomy." He frames his candidacy around representation: that the first openly gay Kansas Senate candidate has a right to run regardless of odds. He has spoken at Democratic forums and has maintained a campaign presence across multiple websites and social media platforms, though organizational infrastructure is minimal.

The most honest assessment of his candidacy is this: Michael Soetaert is not running to win the Democratic primary. He has never won a Democratic primary in any race he has entered for state or federal office. He is running to be heard and to be counted — to put his name, his identity, and his values on the record in Kansas. For what it is, his persistence is remarkable. For what he is claiming to be (a viable Senate candidate), the record does not support the claim.`,

His campaign does not reference faith.`,

    "education": "Associate degree, Cowley County Community College (2017)",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://www.laporte4ksgov.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Chase LaPorte was born in Carthage, Missouri, and now lives in Kansas. He served eight years on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2005 to 2013, and is a member of the Shriners, American Legion, and VFW. He earned an Associate degree from Cowley County Community College in 2017 and works as a business administrator. His public biography is thin: no military rank, unit, or deployment record has been confirmed in available public sources beyond the 2005–2013 service dates.

LaPorte has run for multiple offices across multiple cycles — U.S. House Kansas 3rd Congressional District in a previous cycle, Kansas Governor (he maintains a campaign website called laporte4ksgov.com), and now U.S. Senate in 2026, challenging incumbent Roger Marshall in the Republican primary. The fact that his primary web presence points to a gubernatorial campaign site, not a Senate campaign site, is characteristic of his campaign approach: minimal infrastructure, limited coordination, and a public record that does not reflect a serious effort to defeat a well-funded, Trump-endorsed incumbent.

LaPorte positions himself as a conservative outsider, citing George Washington on term limits and Ronald Reagan on smaller government. His campaign donors have included Governor Ty Masterson and several small-dollar Kansas contributors. He is affiliated with conservative community organizations (Shriners, American Legion, VFW) and presents himself as a veteran with grassroots conservative values. No church affiliation has been identified in any public record.`,

    "theirRecord": `LaPorte has no elected record. His entire public record consists of multiple failed campaign efforts and his eight years of Army service. His campaign platform is skeletal: reduce government spending and inflation, implement term limits, and shrink the size of the federal government. He cites George Washington and Ronald Reagan in his materials but does not specify legislation, committees, or policy details.

His FEC filing is registered (Candidate ID H6KS03258), and his donor list includes small-dollar contributors plus a $2,500 donation from Governor Ty Masterson — the most notable name in his limited public financial record. He does not have a dedicated Senate campaign website; his web presence (laporte4ksgov.com) is oriented toward a gubernatorial campaign. He has received no significant media coverage in the 2026 Senate race beyond his FEC registration.

Roger Marshall holds Trump's "Complete and Total Endorsement," a massive financial advantage ($4.1 million cash on hand vs. LaPorte's negligible fundraising), and an 82% Heritage Action lifetime score. LaPorte has no path to the Republican nomination. His value to the primary is as a protest vehicle for any Kansas Republicans dissatisfied with Marshall — a number that the available evidence suggests is very small.`,

    "party": "D",
    "position": "U.S. House candidate, KS-01",
    "electionSlug": "ks-01-house-2026",
    "incumbent": false,
    "occupation": "Associate Teaching Professor of Law, University of Kansas School of Business",
    "hometown": "Lawrence, Kansas (Douglas County)",
    "education": "B.A. in International Studies, Trinity University, San Antonio, TX (2001)",
    "family": "A professor at the University of Kansas (scientist and bestselling author -- name not confirmed in sources); Yes, raised family in Lawrence (number not specified)",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://colinforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Kenneth Colin McRoberts — he goes by Colin — is an Associate Teaching Professor of Law at the University of Kansas School of Business, where he teaches Business Law, Business Fundamentals, and a course called "The Origin and Spread of Conspiracy Theories." That last course is not incidental: McRoberts spent years as an internationally recognized expert in negotiation, worked with Fortune 500 companies, labor unions, diplomatic teams, and government bodies, and built a specialty in understanding how bad ideas — in negotiations, in politics, in culture — take hold and spread. He is a partner in Vasher McRoberts LLC, a consulting firm. He also teaches negotiation to MBA students at UMKC.

Before his academic career, McRoberts was a commercial litigation attorney at Steptoe & Johnson LLP, a major Washington, D.C.-based law firm, where he secured multimillion-dollar wins defending family businesses from fraud. He holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School (2004). His undergraduate institution has not been confirmed in available public sources, though the State Bar of Texas lists him under Kenneth Colin McRoberts.

McRoberts has raised a family in Lawrence, Kansas, and his wife is described as a professor at the University of Kansas — a scientist and bestselling author whose name has not been confirmed in public sources. He was directly motivated to run by attending Roger Marshall's contentious March 1, 2025 town hall in Oakley, Kansas. That event — where Marshall walked out early amid shouting constituents — went viral, and McRoberts watched it and decided to run. He filed with the FEC on September 17, 2025 (Candidate ID H6KS01195). His campaign slogan distills his professional identity: "I'm running not as a politician, but as a businessman and negotiator."`,

    "theirRecord": `McRoberts has no elected record. His entire public record is professional — Harvard Law graduate, commercial litigator, internationally recognized negotiation expert, university professor. He is running explicitly on that non-political identity, arguing that KS-01's problems are not ideological but practical: the district's incumbent doesn't fight for it, and a skilled negotiator who has made deals under pressure could serve it better than a party loyalist.

His campaign platform centers on affordability (reducing cost of living for families), protecting Social Security and Medicare, restoring Congressional oversight over trade and tariff policy, and fighting the gerrymandering that added Lawrence to the KS-01 district. He has been critical of Tracey Mann in detailed terms — in January 2026, he told the Kansas Reflector that Mann "does not care what that vote does. He doesn't care what it does to his neighbors. He doesn't care what it does to the rest of Kansas. He doesn't care what it does to the rest of the world, as long as it serves his interests."

McRoberts has the largest campaign war chest in the Democratic primary for KS-01 — approximately $7,000 cash on hand, which reflects the near-impossibility of raising significant money in a district that has not elected a Democrat since 1952. He has been listed on the Take Back Congress national Democratic recruitment website. His realistic odds of winning the general election are extremely low (Cook PVI R+38), but he is running the most credible Democratic campaign the district has seen in years.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Lauren Reinhold grew up in Topeka until age 6, then moved to St. Louis, and returned to Kansas in 1993. She entered the University of Kansas School of Law that year and became a lawyer, practicing for 28 years in various capacities — including as a former federal administrative law judge and a former federal union officer working in human resources, advocating for employees. At some point she stepped away from full-time legal practice and became a longtime employee of the Social Security Administration.

Reinhold's personal story of how she came to run for Congress is inseparable from what the Trump administration's DOGE initiative did to her. In late January 2026, she received the email that went to hundreds of thousands of federal employees — the one urging them to quit in exchange for pay through September. After weeks of turmoil, firings, and reassignments across the federal workforce, she accepted a buyout offer when it was extended in April. She was, in her own words, caught in the DOGE purge. And that experience — of watching the government she served for decades be systematically dismantled, and of hearing promises that "prices would be lower and things would be better for your kids" — drove her to run for the House seat in Kansas's 1st Congressional District.

Reinhold has also served as a whistleblower. In 2021, she worked as a volunteer detailee at an Emergency Intake Site at Fort Bliss, Texas — a facility housing unaccompanied migrant children. She and fellow whistleblower Arthur Pearlstein co-authored a letter to Congress alleging that federal contractors at the site had no childcare experience, raising serious concerns about child welfare in federal custody. She raised a family in Lawrence, Kansas. She has children but no spouse name has appeared in public records.`,

    "theirRecord": `Reinhold has no elected record. Her professional record is in federal law and federal employment — 28 years of legal practice, time as a federal administrative law judge, work as a federal union officer, and a long tenure at the Social Security Administration. That record gives her deep institutional knowledge of how the federal government actually works — and equally deep knowledge of how the DOGE workforce reductions are dismantling it.

Her campaign platform centers on protecting working families, strengthening rural communities, and building an affordable future. She toured KS-01 before announcing — stopping in Hays, Dodge City, Salina, and Hutchinson — to understand the district she wants to represent. Her pitch to rural Kansas is that the DOGE purges eliminated the federal workers who processed your Social Security claim, answered your VA benefits question, and ran the USDA programs that funded your rural hospital. That is not abstract policy — it is the lived experience of thousands of KS-01 constituents.

She has spoken at the Kansas Democratic Party forum in Topeka (March 8, 2026) and made appearances in Salina. She entered the race later than McRoberts and, as of the last FEC reporting period, had not yet filed FEC paperwork — suggesting she came in late enough to still be building her fundraising infrastructure. Her campaign messaging is values-driven and worker-focused rather than policy-technical.`,

He lives near Ellinwood in Barton County. His personal details — education, family, spouse, church — are largely undisclosed in public records. His campaign website is musserforuscongress.com.\n\nMusser represents a genuine third-path alternative in a district that Tracey Mann won with 66% in 2024. The United Kansas Party markets itself as cross-partisan and anti-insider, and Musser's campaign emphasizes tax reform, healthcare access, women's rights, and an independent Kansas spirit. He is the least resourced candidate in the KS-01 field with minimal visible fundraising.",
    "theirRecord": "Musser has no prior elected office experience. His campaign is built around the United Kansas Party's brand of pragmatic independence — rejecting both major parties' extremes. His platform emphasizes tax reform, affordable healthcare, women's rights, and what he calls honoring 'the independent spirit that runs deep in Kansas.' As a Health/Safety Manager in a rural Kansas manufacturing facility, he brings a working-class credential that the other candidates in this race lack. However, his campaign infrastructure is extremely limited — very little public biographical information is available, fundraising appears minimal, and the United Kansas Party itself is brand new with no elected officials anywhere in the state.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [

      "His LinkedIn and ZoomInfo traces suggest a long industrial career but not an extensive political one",
      "Craig Musser is the most enigmatic candidate in the race. He has the strongest geographic credentials of any challenger (he actually lives in the rural heart of KS-01, in Ellinwood), and his industrial/manufacturing background is the most aligned with the district's working-class character. But he has virtually no campaign infrastructure -- no website, no social media, no visible fundraising. The United Kansas Party is a new and unproven vehicle. His platform includes a reference to women's rights and self-determination that would be notable and potentially strategic in a post-Dobbs Kansas (where voters overwhelmingly rejected an anti-abortion amendment in 2022). However, without money, media, and organization, he is essentially a placeholder candidate at this stage",

    "campaignWebsite": "https://scottschwab.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Scott Joseph Schwab was born July 9, 1972, in Great Bend, Kansas — a small agricultural city in the heart of the state. He grew up there and attended Fort Hays State University in Hays, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1994. After college he went to work for the Kansas Farm Bureau as a career agent, then moved into pharmaceutical sales and sales training at PMSI-Tmesys, a Fortune 50 company, from 1999 to 2005. He later served as a regional sales manager and eventually Executive Vice President at CompDME, a durable medical equipment company in the Kansas City metro area. He also earned selection as a Rodel Fellow through the Aspen Institute, a competitive civic leadership program for emerging politicians from both parties.

Schwab entered the Kansas House of Representatives in 2003, representing District 49 in the Olathe and Shawnee area of Johnson County. He left in 2006 to run for the Republican nomination in Kansas’s 3rd Congressional District but finished second in that primary with 32.5% of the vote, behind banker Chuck Ahner. He returned to the House in 2009 and served continuously until 2019 — seven total terms. He rose to Speaker Pro Tempore from 2017 to 2019 and chaired the Elections Committee for roughly four years. He won the Secretary of State’s office in 2018 with 50.6% of the vote and was re-elected in 2022. In 2023 he served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, the fifth Kansan to hold that position. He announced his candidacy for governor in January 2025.

Schwab is married to Michele. Together they have four sons: Nathan, Caleb (deceased), Alex, and Isaac. He has spoken about them publicly: "When my kids were born, Nathan was my pleasure, Caleb was my joy, Alex was my delight and Isaac was my treasure." In August 2016, ten-year-old Caleb was killed on the Verruckt waterslide at Schlitterbahn Kansas City when the raft went airborne and he struck a metal support structure. Schwab spoke at the funeral, addressed his son’s friends, and later credited his church community and his faith for helping the family survive. The family reached a $19.7 million wrongful death settlement in January 2017 — reported to be the largest for a minor in Kansas history. In March 2025, Schwab announced he had been diagnosed with Stage 1 lung cancer after a routine screening found a nodule; surgery removed it and doctors said no further treatment was needed. He continued his campaign through recovery.`,

    "theirRecord": `As Elections Committee chairman in the Kansas House, Schwab championed the Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act, which required voter photo ID in Kansas — signed into law in 2011. That bill became one of the most-cited pieces of state election legislation in the country and established his identity as an election-law conservative. As Secretary of State beginning in 2019, he consistently maintained that Kansas elections were secure, fair, and accurate — a position that put him directly at odds with President Trump’s fraud claims after the 2020 election. The Kansas Reflector headlined its November 2020 coverage of him: "As other Republicans lied about voter fraud, Kansas’ secretary of state was a voice of sanity." His exact quote: "Was there organized, rigged fraud that changed the outcome of the election? I have seen no evidence of that." In 2022 he won a Republican primary against conspiracy-aligned challenger Mike Brown 55% to 45%.

Schwab’s Secretary of State record also includes notable controversies. In 2020 he directed a private software company to disable a feature that gave his office easy access to provisional ballot data — effectively blocking a public records request filed by voting rights advocate Davis Hammet. A Kansas Court of Appeals three-judge panel unanimously ruled in July 2022 that this violated the Kansas Open Records Act. The ruling stated that his action — "choosing to conceal rather than reveal public records" — was unlawful. After the ruling Schwab still delayed providing the records. He was also named in a lawsuit from the League of Women Voters over 2021 voting laws that tightened signature match requirements and criminalized some voter registration activities. That case produced a split outcome at the Kansas Supreme Court.

On the governor’s campaign trail, Schwab has made property tax reduction his centerpiece issue, criticizing the 2025 Legislature and Governor Laura Kelly for delivering what he called "a paltry $25.88 property tax break for the owner of a $150,000 home." He supports banning China from buying land near military bases, has aligned with Trump on voter roll maintenance using the federal SAVE database — earning personal praise from the president — and opposes abortion, believing personhood begins at implantation. He loaned his campaign $1.045 million of his own money in 2025, confirming millionaire status, and raised approximately $1.42 million total through year-end 2025.`,

The church was founded in 2002 as a Bible study in Pastor Clint and Mary Sprague’s home. When ten-year-old Caleb Schwab was killed at Schlitterbahn in August 2016, Pastor Sprague served as the family’s public spokesman from the moment the tragedy unfolded, calling Caleb "an incredible young man" who "lit up a room." Caleb’s visitation and funeral service were held at LifeMission Church on August 11–12, 2016. The family had attended church there that same Sunday morning before driving to the waterpark. Schwab has spoken openly about how his faith and his church community carried the family through the loss. In a 2018 FOX4 interview he said: "God is real, and he’s been very real to me. Palpable. To my wife and to our kids, too." His campaign explicitly ties his Christian identity to his public service: "I’m Scott Schwab, a proud son of Great Bend, a Christian, a father, a believer in the American dream."`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Vicki L. Schmidt was born September 15, 1955, in Wichita, Kansas, and grew up there alongside her future husband Mike, whose family lived just two blocks away. They both attended Wichita South High School, went on to the University of Kansas together, and married in 1974. Vicki earned her pharmacy degree from KU's School of Pharmacy in 1978 — and has described herself as a pharmacist for over 40 years. She and Mike have two sons, four grandchildren, and have lived in Topeka for more than 40 years. Dr. Michael J. Schmidt is an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Kansas Orthopedic Society.

Schmidt's pharmacy career shaped her approach to public service. As a state employee working on the Kansas Medical Assistance Program, she discovered errors in the Medicaid drug rebate program that were costing the state millions. She implemented a fix that resulted in more than $391 million in recouped dollars. She helped get funding for KU's School of Pharmacy to move into a new building and expand its doctoral program. In 2019, KU awarded her its Distinguished Service Award — the pharmacy school's highest honor. In 2018, when she was elected Kansas Insurance Commissioner, she became the first pharmacist in Kansas history to hold statewide office — and is reportedly the only elected pharmacist in statewide office in the United States. In May 2023, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went public intentionally — "It's humbling" — underwent surgery and radiation, and was declared cancer-free in September 2023. She said she was aware of at least two women who scheduled mammograms after her announcement and were themselves diagnosed with cancer as a result.

Schmidt ran for governor in July 2025, announcing through a lighthearted video where people in grocery stores, churches, and pickleball courts kept asking if she was running. Her campaign slogan is "It's time Kansans have a governor that works as hard as they do." She raised approximately $980,000 through 2025 — with a modest $81,500 personal loan compared to self-funded rivals — and claims the distinction of the most donor-funded campaign in the GOP primary field, with 800+ individual contributors and 57% of donations from Kansans.`,

    "theirRecord": `Schmidt served in the Kansas Senate from 2005 to 2019, representing District 20 (Shawnee and Wabaunsee counties). She was Assistant Majority Leader from 2009 to 2012 and from 2017 to 2019, and chaired the Public Health and Welfare Committee for six years. She survived the 2012 Brownback "purge" of moderate Republicans — Koch Industries and the Kansas Chamber recruited a challenger against her, and she won her primary by just 160 votes out of 11,000 cast. She later described her 2012 vote for the Brownback income tax cuts — which became the "Kansas experiment" and ultimately cratered state revenues — as one she deeply regrets: "I sincerely regret that I trusted the process to move that along, but I will tell you that I learned a big lesson that day. You can't always trust the process."

Her most notable legislative distinction is being the only Republican in the Kansas Senate to vote against both major anti-abortion bills of her era. She voted against a 2011 bill blocking taxpayer-funded abortions. She voted against the 2015 "Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act" — Kansas was the first state to pass such a ban, and the vote was 31–9; Schmidt was the lone Republican "no." Kansans for Life PAC responded to her governor announcement with a formal statement calling her record "the worst on life of any Republican to ever seek office in Kansas." On her current position: "Like most Kansans, I don't believe in abortion on demand, like some of the far left do. But I do believe in reasonable exceptions." She also fought for and helped pass autism insurance coverage for children under 12 (HB 2744, effective 2014) and helped seed funding for the KU Cancer Center's NCI designation.

As Insurance Commissioner since 2019, Schmidt has recovered more than $202.7 million for Kansas consumers through disputes with insurance companies. She earned the highest vote percentage of any statewide candidate in both 2018 and 2022, winning all four congressional districts in 2022 including one that elected a Democrat. In early 2026, she championed Senate Bill 409, which would have eliminated out-of-pocket costs for follow-up breast imaging — connecting her personal cancer experience to advocacy. The bill died in committee. Democrats and reporters characterized the failure as political retaliation by Senate President Ty Masterson, who controls the legislative calendar and is running against Schmidt in the same primary. Masterson's camp said politics had nothing to do with the bill's failure.`,

      "Married Mike Schmidt in 1974 — over 50 years together — after meeting at Wichita South High School; two sons, four grandchildren",
      "Diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2023; declared cancer-free in September 2023 after surgery and radiation; used the experience to advocate for SB 409 requiring zero-cost follow-up breast imaging",
      "The only Republican in the Kansas Senate to vote against both the 2011 taxpayer-funded abortion ban and the 2015 Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act",
      "Kansans for Life PAC formally called her record 'the worst on life of any Republican to ever seek office in Kansas'",
      "Recovered $202.7 million for Kansas consumers as Insurance Commissioner (2019–present)",
      "Earned the highest vote percentage of any statewide Kansas candidate in both 2018 and 2022 — won all four congressional districts in 2022",
      "Was the first pharmacist ever to hold statewide office in Kansas, and is reportedly the only elected pharmacist in statewide office in the country",
      "Boycotted the January 2026 GOP debate because the Republican Party charged candidates $10,000 to participate — stated: 'Under this agreement, the party picks winners and losers'",
      "Her church affiliation has not been publicly identified, though her campaign announcement video includes a scene at church and her biography references upbringing focused on 'hard work, honesty, and faith'"
    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Vicki Schmidt has not publicly identified her specific church or denomination in campaign materials or interviews. Her campaign announcement video (July 9, 2025) includes a scene at church, and her official biography states she and husband Mike shared upbringings "focused on hard work, honesty, and faith." She references faith as a background value rather than a centerpiece of her public identity. Given her 40+ years in Topeka and her moderate Kansas Republican background, she likely attends a mainline Protestant church, but that has not been confirmed in available public sources.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Ty Marlo Masterson was born September 23, 1969, in El Dorado, Kansas, in Butler County, and grew up in the Wichita area. He attended Kansas State University and went into small business — owning a construction company, working in real estate, and serving on the Andover City Council before running for the Kansas House in 2004. He represents Senate District 16 in the Andover/Sedgwick County area and has been a state senator since 2009. He and his wife Marlo have been married for more than 30 years and have six children: Kaely, Mendy, TJ, Abby, Marshal, and Kenzy — plus five grandchildren. Alongside his legislative work, Masterson has served for roughly a decade as Executive Director of GoCreate, a Koch Industries–funded 18,000-square-foot makerspace at Wichita State University that offers manufacturing tools, equipment, and training. He takes unpaid leave during legislative sessions, though a Democratic colleague proposed eliminating state funding for the GoCreate director position in 2026, arguing Masterson was "drawing two taxpayer-funded salaries."

Masterson became Kansas Senate President in January 2021, elected unanimously by Republican colleagues. He founded the Truth Caucus in 2017, a conservative bloc of over 60 House and Senate legislators, and served as the 2024 National Chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the influential conservative policy organization. His campaign network includes a 501(c)(4) dark money nonprofit called Take Back Kansas, created by Trump 2024 campaign operatives — Chris Grant of MAGA Inc., pollster-partner David Lee, and data consultant Tim Saler. The group entered 2026 with $700,000 in its account. Masterson announced his governor's candidacy July 20, 2025, with the slogan "Let's Take Back Kansas," saying: "Tangling with Laura Kelly these last few years has taught me I can only do so much from the position I'm in."

In 2010 or 2011, Masterson filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy with approximately $885,000 in unsecured debts — the result of his construction company's failure and losses in real estate and commercial ventures. The filing occurred while he was serving on the Kansas Senate Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the state budget. He attributed the bankruptcy to banks that "decided to no longer work with me." The filing was first publicly reported in December 2012.`,

    "theirRecord": `Masterson's tenure as Senate President has been defined by his confrontations with Democratic Governor Laura Kelly and his role driving the Kansas Republican supermajority's legislative agenda. He pushed a flat income tax bill (SB 169) proposing a 4.75% rate for all Kansans, overrode the governor's veto on a transgender sports ban in 2023 (House 84–40, Senate 28–12), led the override of the gender-affirming care ban for minors in 2025, and in March 2026 led the override of both the bathroom bill (SB 244) and the pregnancy center CARE Act. After the health care sharing ministries tax bill override on March 27, 2026, Masterson walked to the ceremonial bell outside the House chamber and rang it. Democrats called it gloating and demanded a point of order; Masterson posted on X: "We won for lower healthcare costs. We will ring that bell every time we put more money back in Kansans' pockets."

Masterson has been a consistent and personal opponent of marijuana legalization in Kansas. Despite polling showing 70% of Kansans support medical cannabis, he has personally ensured marijuana legislation never reaches the Senate floor. He warned that legalization could fuel "gang activity," dismissed supportive polling by saying "they don't know what they're actually saying yes to," and opposed Medicaid expansion by calling it an expansion of "the welfare state." He championed the cell phone ban in schools (SB 302, "Bell to Bell, No Cell," signed into law March 2026) and led redistricting efforts in fall 2025 designed to disadvantage Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids. He also created the Committee on Government Efficiency (COGE) modeled on federal DOGE, but that committee restricted 1,500+ public submissions until after the session — which legal experts said violated the Kansas Open Records Act.

He has not been without controversy in his own party. When Charlotte O'Hara attacked him at the January 2026 debate for being too friendly with Democrats, he gestured at fellow Republican candidates and said: "This is not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy." He also told Hugh Hewitt in December 2025 that the Kansas Reflector was "a kind of a Soros-funded blog that masquerades as the news" — a claim the Reflector's editor denied and its opinion editor mocked in a satirical column comparing Masterson to a raccoon that drank peanut butter whiskey.`,

    "whereTheyWorship": `Ty Masterson attends NewSpring Church in Wichita, Kansas — a contemporary, non-denominational evangelical congregation. He has publicly stated "I'm a follower of Jesus Christ" and explicitly connects his faith to his legislative priorities. His pro-life position is framed around the conviction that "every life is precious, created by God." His legislative agenda on pregnancy centers, gender-affirming care, bathroom policy, and health care sharing ministries all reflect conservative Christian values. He does not compartmentalize faith from governance. NewSpring Church maintains a presence on Instagram, X, and Facebook under @newspringkansas and has a podcast on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Jeff Colyer was born June 3, 1960, in Hays, Kansas — making him the only Kansas governor ever from Hays. His father, James Daniel Colyer DDS, was a World War II Navy veteran who survived the invasion of Peleliu, graduated from Fort Hays State University and Creighton dental school, and practiced dentistry in Hays for 30 years (1955–1985). The Colyer family belonged to St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Hays and kept a small farm outside town where they raised Pony of the Americas horses and showed them at the Kansas State Fair. Jeff attended Thomas More Prep-Marian, the Catholic high school in Hays, graduating in 1978. He has said that TMP shaped the direction of his life. His mother's battle with breast cancer was an early influence on his decision to pursue medicine.

Colyer earned a BA in Economics from Georgetown University in 1981, then an MA in International Relations from Clare Hall at Cambridge University in 1982. Before medical school he worked as an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, co-authoring multiple editions of The Military Balance — the world's leading annual assessment of global military capabilities. He earned his MD from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 1986 and completed residency and fellowship training in craniofacial and plastic surgery. From 1988 to 1989 he served as a White House Fellow under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, focused on international affairs. He opened his private plastic and craniofacial surgery practice in Overland Park in 1994 and has operated on more than 20,000 patients. He married Ruth Gutierrez in 1991; she was alongside him in Rwanda and has her own extraordinary resume in oncology research, genetic therapy, and consulting. They have three daughters: Alexandra, Serena, and Dominique.

No other candidate in this governor's race — and few in any American political race — can match Colyer's humanitarian record. Over 35+ years with the International Medical Corps, beginning with a 1985 mission into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan, he has volunteered as a surgeon in active war zones across more than 20 countries. The defining mission came in 1994: Colyer was the only surgeon in all of southern Rwanda while 800,000 people were being murdered in the genocide. His wife Ruth served alongside him. He performed reconstructive surgery on trauma victims and trained local medical personnel under dire conditions. Most recently, in 2024, he spent a month at Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro, Ukraine, treating Russian war casualties and describing the injuries as "in a category far above what we're seeing in other conflicts." He has lectured on his firsthand experiences at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.`,

    "theirRecord": `Colyer entered the Kansas House in 2007, was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2009, and was selected as Sam Brownback's running mate in 2010. He served as the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 2011 to 2018. His signature achievement in that role was designing KanCare, Kansas's privatized Medicaid system, which he claims saved $2–2.5 billion since 2013 while increasing services, reducing inpatient hospital stays by 23%, and increasing primary care use by 24% — all without cutting provider payments. He also oversaw a $500 million increase in public school funding over five years to address Kansas Supreme Court rulings on inadequate education financing.

When Brownback resigned in January 2018 to become Trump's Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Colyer was sworn in as the 47th Governor of Kansas the same day. He inherited a $500 million deficit with $876 cash in the checking account and left office 11 months later with an $800 million surplus — without raising taxes. He made his first executive order a mandatory annual sexual harassment training policy for all 20,000 executive branch employees, the first such mandatory policy in Kansas gubernatorial history. He also signed Senate Bill 284 protecting faith-based adoption agencies that decline to place children in LGBTQ+ homes, stating: "Catholic Charities and other adoption agencies are key to the fabric of our communities." In August 2018 he ran for a full term as governor in the Republican primary — and lost to Secretary of State Kris Kobach by approximately 345 votes out of 313,000 cast. Trump had endorsed Kobach. Colyer conceded graciously without requesting a recount. Kobach subsequently lost the general election to Democrat Laura Kelly.

Colyer entered the 2022 race, earned an endorsement from Sen. Roger Marshall and signed up Mary Eisenhower (granddaughter of President Eisenhower) as campaign treasurer — then withdrew on August 30, 2021, after announcing a prostate cancer diagnosis, the same disease that had afflicted both his father and grandfather. He underwent treatment, recovered, endorsed Trump for president in a Newsweek column in November 2023, served as Trump's 2024 Kansas Campaign Chairman, and formally launched his third run for governor on May 14, 2025. He raised approximately $2.07 million through 2025, including $1.05 million in personal loans, giving him the largest war chest in the Republican field.`,

    ],

    "whereTheyWorship": `Jeff Colyer was raised in a Catholic family in Hays, Kansas. His family attended St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Hays, confirmed through his father's obituary. He attended Thomas More Prep-Marian, a Catholic high school in Hays, which he has credited with shaping his life direction. His father's funeral was held with a rosary, a funeral Mass at St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in Leawood, and burial at Resurrection Catholic Cemetery in Lenexa — all Catholic rites. Colyer signed Senate Bill 284 as governor specifically protecting Catholic Charities and other faith-based adoption agencies. His current specific church has not been publicly confirmed in available sources, though his humanitarian service through the International Medical Corps, his consistent pro-life positions, and his Catholic schooling all point to a faith that shapes his actions more than his public statements.`,

    "campaignWebsite": "https://ethanforkansas.com",
    "whoTheyAre": "Ethan Corson was born in 1982 and raised in Johnson County, Kansas. He graduated from Shawnee Mission South High School, then attended Garden City Community College where he played baseball as a left-handed pitcher and was named Academic All-American. He went on to earn a B.S. in Political Science, Journalism, and Communication from Washington University in St. Louis, then his Juris Doctor from Washington University School of Law.\n\nAfter law school, Corson spent seven years as an attorney at a Washington, D.C. law firm specializing in labor law and workers' rights. He then served as Director and Executive Secretariat at the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Senior Advisor to Secretary Penny Pritzker under President Obama. He was Chief of Staff of the International Trade Administration, managing 2,200+ employees across 75 countries.\n\nCorson returned to Kansas in 2019 to serve as Executive Director of the Kansas Democratic Party, leading the party through its most successful election cycle in a decade — including the election of Governor Laura Kelly and Representative Sharice Davids. He was elected to the Kansas State Senate (District 7, Fairway) in November 2020. He is married to Jenna Brofsky, an attorney at Husch Blackwell who previously served on the Fairway City Council. They have two sons, Isaac and Aiden. Corson is Jewish — his wife grew up attending a Conservative synagogue in a suburb of New York City.",
    "theirRecord": "In the Kansas Senate, Corson serves as Ranking Minority Member on both the Judiciary and Transportation committees, and sits on Assessment and Taxation, Utilities, Legislative Post Audit, and the Russ Jennings Joint Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice Oversight. His legislative focus includes education funding, lowering cost of living for working families, workforce development, small business support, and rural healthcare access.\n\nCorson's campaign for Governor runs on the tagline 'Common sense, common ground.' His platform centers on strengthening public schools, lowering taxes for working families, expanding rural healthcare, protecting Kansas farmers from federal tariff damage, and rebuilding rural Kansas through small business support. He has crisscrossed 8,000 miles across Kansas campaigning in rural areas — the Democratic Party's greatest weakness in the state.\n\nCorson has secured the endorsement trifecta of Governor Laura Kelly, former Governor Kathleen Sebelius, and U.S. Representative Sharice Davids. His fundraising is the strongest in the Democratic field: $902,641 raised in 2025 with 3,000+ contributors, 70% of donations under $100, and zero personal loans — a genuinely grassroots-funded campaign with $526,975 cash on hand.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Corson is one of the most institutionally connected Democrats in the race",
      "He is a credible Jewish candidate in Kansas statewide politics, which matters in the public record even though no synagogue was verified here",
      "The campaign site leans heavily on opportunity, schools, and taxes rather than identity politics",
      "The campaign home page surfaces an active social feed and policy-heavy messaging",
      "His official Senate committee work and Dole Institute fellowship remain part of his public brand",
      "His prior work at the Kansas Democratic Party and Commerce Department provides a notable executive/government background",
      "Ethan Corson goes to church. The Sunday school reference is specific and personal -- this is not a politician saying \"I'm a person of faith.\" He is describing a weekly family routine of church attendance with his kids. \"Making pancakes with the boys before Sunday school\" is a lived detail, not a talking point. However, the specific church and denomination were not identified. The \"Pastor Dallas\" reference and the Black History Month church visit suggest he may attend a mainline Protestant or multicultural congregation. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Corson is the strongest Democratic candidate by every measurable metric: money, endorsements, and institutional support. His \"common sense, common ground\" messaging is designed to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents in a red state. His Jewish faith is notable in a heavily Christian state -- he does not appear to foreground it. His labor law background and union representation work will be a double-edged sword: appeals to working families but provides ammunition for Republican attacks. His time at the Kansas Democratic Party gives him deep institutional knowledge of the state's political machinery. The 8,000-mile crisscross of Kansas shows a serious effort to compete in rural areas, which is the Democratic Party's greatest weakness in the state"

    "electionSlug": "kansas-governor-2026",

    "occupation": "State Senator",
    "family": "Husband: Greg Holscher",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://cindyforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": "Cynthia L. Holscher was born April 26, 1969, in Slater, Missouri. Her grandparents were tenant farmers. Her father was a union construction worker and her mother was an elementary school custodian. She was the first person in her family to graduate from college, earning degrees in Journalism, Marketing, and Political Science from the University of Missouri.\n\nAfter college, Holscher built a career at Sprint Corporation, where she spent over a decade designing and overseeing multi-million-dollar budgets and winning awards in employee development. She has lived in Overland Park, Kansas for more than 25 years with her husband Greg. They have three children, all graduates of Kansas public schools.\n\nHolscher entered politics in 2016 by defeating Republican incumbent Amanda Grosserode for Kansas House District 16. She was re-elected in 2018, then moved to the Kansas Senate in 2020 by defeating former Republican Rep. James Todd. She won re-election in 2024 by 23 points. She co-founded the Women’s Bipartisan Caucus in the Kansas Legislature. No church or faith affiliation has been publicly identified — this is a notable gap in her public profile for a Kansas statewide candidate.",
    "theirRecord": "Holscher has served 9 years in the Kansas Legislature — 4 in the House and 5+ in the Senate. She was part of the bipartisan coalition that reversed the Brownback-era tax cuts in 2017 and fought to expand Medicaid eligibility (which passed the House but fell short of overcoming Brownback’s veto).\n\nHer campaign platform centers on ‘kitchen table issues’: strong public school funding, fierce opposition to school vouchers, Medicaid expansion, protecting the ACA, addressing maternal and infant mortality, supporting reproductive freedom, and legalizing medical marijuana. She campaigns explicitly on working across the aisle.\n\nHolscher publicly accused Governor Kelly’s staff of pressuring her and other Democrats to drop out of the governor’s race so Chris Mann could run instead. She said: ‘All three of us were told basically do not run because Chris Mann is the guy’ and ‘Why are insiders picking candidates? We are being bullied, essentially.’ She has $397,000 raised and $179,000 cash on hand — significantly behind Corson’s $902,000. She notably does NOT have the Kelly/Sebelius/Davids endorsement trifecta that Corson secured.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Holscher is one of the strongest policy-focused Democrats in the race and an established state senator",
      "Her public story is rooted in working-class background, education activism, and family economics",
      "She is openly running a fully organized campaign with social media, donation flows, and issue pages",
      "The about page is unusually specific about her family background, education activism, and statewide school-funding work",
      "Her campaign has more social footprint than many people in the field, including Facebook, Instagram, and X",
      "Kansas political coverage has also tied her to statewide fights over education and, in 2025, the insurance-commissioner race",
      "The UU church and Episcopal church appearances appear to be campaign events held at church facilities, not indicators of personal membership. Many candidates use church halls as community meeting spaces. No personal faith identity found. In a Democratic primary, candidates are less likely to lead with faith credentials. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Holscher has the most compelling personal narrative in the Democratic field -- granddaughter of tenant farmers, daughter of a construction worker and school custodian, first-generation college graduate, single mom who worked her way up through Sprint. Her legislative record is genuinely bipartisan, and her 9 years in the statehouse give her more governing experience than Corson. But the Kelly-endorsed Corson has outflanked her on money and endorsements. Her school voucher critique is razor-sharp and resonates in rural Kansas where there simply are no private schools. Her silence on faith is notable -- in Kansas politics, that is a gap that opponents will exploit. The pressure campaign story is politically damaging to the Democratic establishment more than to Holscher herself"

    "campaignWebsite": "https://www.tuley4gov2026.com/about-marty",
    "whoTheyAre": "Marty Tuley is an author, personal trainer, and former gym owner from Lawrence, Kansas running for the Democratic nomination for Governor with no prior political experience. He describes himself as a fourth-generation Kansan with roots in farming, football, and classroom learning. His family is ‘made up of farmers, teachers, and working people.’ He is married to Lovena Tuley.\n\nTuley is a long-shot candidate who stands out primarily for one position that is unusual for a Democrat: he opposes transgender athletes competing in girls’ sports. This puts him at odds with the mainstream Democratic platform on LGBTQ+ issues while potentially giving him crossover appeal with conservative voters. Beyond this, his platform centers on public schools, health and fitness, economics, and common-sense governance.",
    "theirRecord": "Tuley has no prior elected office or government experience. His campaign is built on an outsider identity — ‘not born into politics’ — with a platform focused on public education, healthcare access, fitness and wellness, and economic opportunity. His opposition to transgender athletes in girls’ sports is the most distinctive policy position in the Democratic primary field and the one most likely to generate attention. He maintains active social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, suggesting a digital-first campaign approach. His campaign website is tuley4gov2026.com.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Tuley is still the least-developed campaign in the governor field, with the thinnest public record",
      "He is trying to build a broad, nonpartisan Kansas-values brand rather than a deep ideological machine",
      "The campaign infrastructure exists, including social accounts and donation flows, but the candidate footprint is small",
      "The website itself is a major source of public information for Tuley; the campaign did not rely heavily on third-party coverage in this pass",
      "The page includes straightforward issue tabs for public schools, health and fitness, and economics",
      "His message is written in plain language and targets voters fatigued by partisan politics",
      "Tuley is a political novice with no realistic path to the nomination. However, his candidacy is interesting because he breaks the Democratic mold on transgender athletes -- a position that could theoretically appeal to moderate Kansas voters but will alienate the progressive base. His \"obesity as a statewide health crisis\" framing is unique in this race. His background as a personal trainer/gym owner/fitness author gives him a distinctive profile, though the 2003 legal troubles with Total Fitness Athletic Center are a potential vulnerability that opponents could exploit. He has virtually no fundraising apparatus and no institutional support. His debate participation gives him a platform but not a realistic shot at winning",

    "whoTheyAre": "Charlotte O'Hara is a hard-right populist Republican from Overland Park running for Governor. She was raised on a farm in Bourbon County, Kansas, graduated from KU, and spent over 20 years as a general contractor. She homeschooled her two youngest children and now co-owns a small manufacturing company in Olathe with two of her sons — the company's products include casino gambling chips. She is a mother of 5 and grandmother of 7.\n\nO'Hara served in the Kansas House of Representatives (District 27, 2011-2013) and on the Johnson County Commission (2021-2025). She has also served as a Republican district chairwoman and precinct committeewoman. She is the MAGA populist attack dog of the governor's field — she will not win the primary but could damage other candidates with her aggressive debate style.",
    "theirRecord": "At the January 30, 2026 GOP governor's debate, O'Hara launched aggressive attacks on Scott Schwab (over destroyed Johnson County election ballots after 2020) and Ty Masterson (over economic development deals with Governor Kelly). Both were given extra time to respond.\n\nHer platform is explicitly hard-right populist: 'Rein in spending — DOGE must come to Kansas! The era of fraud, waste and bloated bureaucracy is over!' She opposes DEI, CRT, and 'WOKE' in public schools. She opposes STAR bond tax incentive packages, specifically targeting the Chiefs and Royals stadium deals. She supports direct election of Kansas Supreme Court justices. She wants to protect the environment from 'industrial wind/solar facilities and lithium-ion battery plants.' During COVID, she refused masks and vaccines and opposed school and business closures while serving on the Johnson County Commission.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "O'Hara is one of the more ideologically hard-right candidates in the field",
      "Her self-funding is substantial and is a major part of her campaign finance story",
      "She has an established history in Johnson County politics and is not a novice",
      "The campaign site presents her as a contractor, homeschool parent, and business owner, which is a stronger image than a typical one-page political landing page",
      "Her campaign language is unusually explicit about opposition to masking, vaccines, and shutdowns",
      "The campaign site also emphasizes her role on the Johnson County Commission and Kansas House",
      "O'Hara is a populist firebrand who will not win the nomination but will make noise. Her combative style already cost her the Johnson County Commissioner seat in 2024, and Masterson publicly called out her approach as damaging to Republican general election prospects. Her anti-STAR bond position on the Chiefs/Royals stadium deal is actually popular with fiscal conservatives, and her \"DOGE must come to Kansas\" messaging taps into the current national mood. But at 75 with a recent electoral loss by 7 points in her own district, she lacks the credibility and resources to compete. Her prolific column-writing is both her greatest asset (transparency) and greatest liability (ammunition for opponents). She is a spoiler candidate who could pull votes from the right flank",

Kansas First.\" and repeatedly emphasizes plainspoken, low-drama politics.\n\nThe public record in this sweep did not surface a substantial elected-office history, which makes her biography more entrepreneurial and campaign-driven than legislative.\n\nFull Name: Stacy Rogers (nee Hepner).",
    "theirRecord": "I did not find a prior legislative voting record for Rogers in public state records reviewed here.\n\nThe most notable public action in the record is her early filing and the way she positioned herself as the first candidate to declare and file.\n\nNo major court, disciplinary, or governmental controversy surfaced in this pass.\n\nDay One Executive Order: \"Go through each Department with a fine tooth comb, root out inefficiencies, mishandling and fraud.",

Her early declaration and first-to-file status show ambition, but her fundraising is essentially nonexistent compared to the major candidates. Her \"first female Republican governor\" angle is noteworthy but insufficient without serious money. Her platform is standard conservative (government efficiency, property taxes, pro-life) without a distinctive breakthrough message. The Kids Closet national franchise business is actually a more impressive credential than it initially appears -- running a national franchise system requires real organizational skill. But without a fundraising breakthrough, she is a long-shot candidate",

Her Theological Studies background and company name \"Cornerstone\" suggest a faith-rooted worldview without being heavy-handed. But her campaign is almost entirely self-funded ($1M personal loan out of $1.14M total), which raises questions about grassroots support. Her explicit Trump alignment (\"golden age\") may help in a Republican primary but could be a liability in the general. Her school board experience (won by just 46 votes, chose not to run for re-election) is thin public service experience.

    "campaignWebsite": "https://chrismannforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": `Chris Mann grew up watching his father leave for work every day as a police officer. He chose the same path. In 1998, while still a junior at the University of Kansas, he became one of the youngest officers in the Lawrence Police Department at age 21. Three years later, his career ended in a moment. On January 11, 2002, at approximately 3:30 in the morning, Mann had pulled over a vehicle for a broken taillight. An intoxicated driver slammed into his parked patrol cruiser at 50 miles per hour. The force threw Mann into the back of the SUV he had pulled over and deposited him 30 feet away on the side of the road. The crash caused severe injuries and he was forced to retire from the force at roughly age 25. He spent years in intensive physical therapy recovering.

Rather than stepping away from public service, Mann decided to keep fighting crime from the courtroom. He enrolled at Washburn University School of Law on a full-ride Koch Public Service Scholarship, designed for students planning to enter public affairs, and graduated around 2010. He prosecuted hundreds of cases — including murder, robbery, and drug offenses — as an Assistant District Attorney in Wyandotte County from 2011 to 2013. From 2013 to 2017 he served as Senior Staff Attorney and Special Prosecutor at the Kansas Office of the Securities Commissioner, handling complex white-collar securities fraud and protecting elderly Kansans from scam artists. He opened the Mann Law Firm in Lawrence in 2016 or 2017, concentrating on DUI defense and criminal cases for clients who cannot afford attorneys. He describes the decision to serve underserved Kansans as "answering the call of his faith."

Mann is married to Ashley Mann, a cardiothoracic surgeon practicing in the Topeka or Olathe area, who supported his decision to open the firm. They have two children — daughter Skylar (approximately 10) and son William (approximately 6) — and live in Lawrence. Mann became deeply involved with Mothers Against Drunk Driving after his accident: he served as Kansas Advisory Board Chair in 2011, joined the national board in 2014, and became national board chair until 2020. He advocated for Kansas legislation requiring ignition interlock devices for DUI offenders. In 2022 he challenged Kris Kobach for Attorney General — his first run for elected office — and lost by just 1.6 percentage points, the closest statewide race in Kansas that cycle. He outraised Kobach nearly 2:1 ($950,000 to $465,000). He is running again in 2026 and by end of 2025 had raised approximately $537,000 — more than double his fundraising pace from the equivalent period in the 2022 cycle.`,

    "theirRecord": `Mann has never held elected office. His record is built from law enforcement, prosecution, and advocacy work. As an Assistant DA in Wyandotte County, he prosecuted hundreds of criminal cases across multiple categories. As a Special Prosecutor at the Kansas Securities Commissioner's office, he put away white-collar fraudsters who had stolen life savings from elderly Kansans. As national chairman of MADD, he represented one of America's most recognized victim-advocacy organizations and championed state-level legislation requiring breathalyzer-connected ignition locks for convicted drunk drivers. His supporters — including the Democratic Attorneys General Association, Kansas NEA, UAW, Kansas AFL-CIO, and a bipartisan group of 140+ Republican, Democratic, and Independent attorneys who wrote that "Kris Kobach is not a good attorney" — endorsed him in 2022.

In the 2022 campaign, Mann won Johnson County (Kansas City suburbs), Douglas County (Lawrence, his home), Shawnee County (Topeka), Riley County (Manhattan), and Lyon County (Emporia) — five of 105 Kansas counties. He came within 1,800 votes of flipping Sedgwick County (Wichita, the second-most populous). He lost because straight-ticket Republican voting in rural Kansas overwhelmed his urban and suburban margins. His 2026 campaign frames the race as "law enforcement vs. politician" and explicitly targets Kobach's record of using the AG office for political purposes — suing over immigration, transgender athletes, and other culture-war causes — rather than core public safety functions.

Mann's policy platform emphasizes fentanyl trafficking, drug distribution networks, retail crime, and white-collar fraud as priorities. He supports women's right to make private medical decisions and has stated he will not use AG office resources to attack constitutional rights — a direct reference to the 2022 Value Them Both referendum that rejected abortion restrictions by 18 points. He owns guns and supports the Second Amendment while believing violent offenders should not have access to firearms. On marijuana he personally believes in well-regulated medical cannabis but says he will enforce current law. He supports ending dark money in Kansas elections and strengthening open records laws. He has raised 89% of his 2026 contributions from Kansas donors.`,

    "whoTheyAre": `Pat Proctor, PhD, is a retired U.S. Army Colonel who served 25 years on active duty before entering Kansas politics. He earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 1994, then spent a quarter century in the Army, deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq, serving as operations officer in Tikrit, and finishing his career as a Battalion Commander in Jordan. Along the way he earned three master's degrees — from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the School of Advanced Military Studies, and the U.S. Army War College — and a doctorate in History from Kansas State University in 2014. He lives in historic Leavenworth, Kansas, just outside the gates of Fort Leavenworth, with his wife Aree.

After retiring from the Army, Proctor moved into academia. He taught at Benedictine College and is currently an Assistant Professor in the Homeland Security Program at Wichita State University's School of Criminal Justice. He has published four books, including works on the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Vietnam War, and the end of combat operations in Iraq. His academic articles have appeared in The Historian, Parameters, Military Review, and other peer-reviewed journals. He was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 2020, representing District 41 in Leavenworth, and became chairman of the House Elections Committee.

Proctor was the first Republican to formally declare for the 2026 Kansas Secretary of State race, announcing his candidacy in April 2025. He frames his campaign around the slogan "Restoring Confidence in Our Elections, Growing Our Economy" and presents his military background as proof he has "defended democracy" and is uniquely qualified to protect Kansas elections. His campaign had raised approximately $312,000 as of January 2026, including a $134,000 personal loan, giving him a commanding fundraising advantage over his primary opponent Ken Rahjes.`,

    "theirRecord": `As chairman of the House Elections Committee, Proctor has been among the most aggressive legislators in the country on election restrictions. In the 2025–2026 session he authored or advanced a package of bills that significantly tightened Kansas voting rules. HB 2437, which passed the House 80–43, deputizes the Secretary of State to cross-reference voter rolls against the federal SAVE database twice a year, restricts voter registration websites to .gov domains, and requires counties to remove voters from rolls when funeral homes publish obituaries. HB 2569 would eliminate no-excuse mail-in voting entirely if any Kansas judge invalidates the state's ballot signature verification law. HB 2491, which passed 87–37, requires that personal information for non-citizens receiving public benefits be shared with the Secretary of State's office.

A private Zoom recording from February 2024 — leaked in February 2025 by Loud Light Civic Action — showed Proctor telling Johnson County Republicans: "If it was up to me, Election Day would be Election Day," indicating he would prefer to eliminate advanced and early voting entirely. He also vowed to "ram through" legislation to eliminate the three-day post-election grace period for mail-in ballots — and that grace period was indeed eliminated by subsequent legislation. When Kansas Reflector reporters asked Proctor to clarify contradictory statements about his "axis of ballot harvesting" phrase, he responded: "You are a partisan hack and your so-called 'newspaper' is a woke, leftist propaganda rag." He repeated that characterization on a second occasion.

Proctor's campaign platform asserts that "voter confidence that the results of our elections reflect their will is at the core of our form of government and our way of life" and promises to make Kansas "the gold-standard for safe and secure elections." He positions his military service as evidence of integrity and patriotism. Critics — including the Kansas Reflector and voting rights groups — argue his legislation would make it harder for Kansas citizens to vote, particularly those who rely on mail-in ballots and early voting.`,

      "Currently an Assistant Professor at Wichita State University's School of Criminal Justice",

    "whereTheyWorship": `No public church affiliation has been confirmed for Pat Proctor in available sources. His military and academic background dominate his public identity.

He lives in the Leavenworth area, which has a variety of military-community churches, but his specific congregation has not been publicly identified.`,

He attended Colby Community College, studied agriculture communications at Kansas State University, and has worked as an agriculture broadcaster. He has been married to Lori (Hoopingarner) Rahjes for 35 years. They have four grown children and one granddaughter. He lives and works on the family farm/ranch in Agra.\n\nRahjes has served 10+ years in the Kansas Legislature, chairing the Agriculture Committee and serving as Majority Caucus Chair. He represents the pragmatic, traditional Kansas Republican governance lane — more focused on business services and rural accessibility than election conspiracy theories. He is significantly out-raised by his primary opponent Pat Proctor ($24,000 vs Proctor's $312,000).",
    "theirRecord": "As a candidate for Secretary of State, Rahjes takes a measured approach compared to his primary opponent Pat Proctor. Where Proctor chairs the Elections Committee and pushes aggressive election restriction bills, Rahjes focuses on streamlining business filings, improving the One Stop online portal for Kansas businesses, working with county clerks on election transparency, and maintaining existing election security procedures without dramatic new restrictions. His campaign message is 'Let us make Kansas business-friendly again.' He represents the traditional Kansas Republican who sees the Secretary of State's office as primarily a business services and records office, not an election-warfare platform.",

His focus is on business services and rural accessibility rather than voter restriction. However, his fundraising deficit of ~$290,000 is a significant structural disadvantage in the primary",

She is married to Jesse Day, and they run 11-Eleven, a real estate investment business. She has served as Vice President of the Johnson County League of Women Voters and worked 7 years as an election worker — giving her direct hands-on experience with how Kansas elections are actually administered at the ground level.\n\nDay is the strongest Democratic candidate in the Secretary of State race, having raised approximately $50,000. She was previously endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, and AFL-CIO in her House race.",

Her pitch is administrative competence over ideological warfare — protecting the integrity of Kansas elections while keeping the office focused on its core functions: business filings, elections administration, and public records.

He has a working-class background spanning construction testing, retail, shipping, and food service — a line cook's resume, not a politician's. He claims descent from Abolitionist James Henry Lane, one of Kansas's first U.S. Senators. His family, spouse, and personal details are not publicly identified. He is a long-shot candidate with minimal fundraising and no prior political experience.",
    "theirRecord": "Lane has no prior elected office or government experience. His campaign is built around the idea that the Secretary of State's office should be run by someone who 'plays fair and takes the job seriously' rather than a partisan warrior. He has said: 'In Kansas, the Secretary of State oversees elections, and if you do not have a Secretary of State that plays fair and takes the job seriously, you do not have fair elections, and without fair elections, you do not have a democratic republic.' He is the least financially developed candidate in the race but represents a genuine outsider voice in a field dominated by professional politicians.",

      "Lane is a long-shot candidate running as an independent-turned-Democrat with minimal fundraising and no political experience. His working-class background and plainspoken approach may resonate in a primary, but he faces a significant disadvantage against Jennifer Day's name recognition and organizational support",

He married his college sweetheart Diane in 1985; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\nHawkins has been in the insurance business since 1995 and owns The Hawkins Group, Inc., an employee benefits insurance agency he started in 1991. He was elected to the Kansas House in 2012 representing District 100 in Wichita, rose to House Majority Leader (2019-2023), then became Speaker in 2023. He is term-limited as Speaker under a rule passed in 2023 limiting speakers to two consecutive terms.\n\nHis community service includes 5 years on the board of Higher Ground (a faith-based organization, including 2 years as Treasurer and 1 year as Chair) and 6 years on the board of Make-A-Wish Foundation of Kansas. His campaign treasurer is Mary Jean Eisenhower — granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His campaign website opens with 'PRO-LIFE. PRO-GUN. PRO-TRUMP.' in bold letters.",

When 50+ frustrated Republicans prepared to force the bill to the floor, Hawkins and Majority Leader Chris Croft suddenly ended the House session. The bill ultimately passed 104-17, overruling the Speaker by a veto-proof margin from his own party.",
      "His campaign website opens with 'PRO-LIFE. PRO-GUN. PRO-TRUMP.' as the first thing visitors see. He describes himself as 'a strong supporter of President Trump' who will serve as 'a vocal ally for his agenda.'",
      "He spent 30 years in the insurance industry as president of The Hawkins Group, an employee benefits agency — and now wants to be the state's insurance regulator. Critics call this a conflict of interest: the industry insider becoming the industry watchdog.",
      "He raised $427,300 in 2025, which his campaign claims breaks all previous records for down-ballot Kansas races at this point in an election cycle.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Dinah Sykes was born April 10, 1977, and lives in Lenexa, Kansas with her husband Jeffrey and their two sons, William and Tyler. She earned a B.A. in Business Administration with minors in Finance and Economics from Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, Tennessee — a university affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene, whose international headquarters happens to be in Lenexa, the same city where Sykes lives.\n\nBefore politics, Sykes worked as a development officer in higher education, ran her own business as a personal chef, and became PTA President at her children's school. She describes herself as 'a shy kid' who got politically motivated by frustration with school budget cuts and unresponsive legislators. She won a Kansas Senate seat in 2016 — as a Republican.\n\nOn December 19, 2018, Sykes switched from Republican to Democrat in a coordinated, high-profile defection with three other female Kansas legislators: Senator Barbara Bollier, Representative Joy Koesten, and Representative Stephanie Clayton. The move made national news on CNN, Salon, and other outlets. She has served as Senate Minority Leader since 2021 — the first woman to hold the title in Kansas history.",
    "theirRecord": "Sykes has served in the Kansas Senate for 9 years representing District 21 in the Lenexa area of Johnson County. As Senate Minority Leader, she is the top-ranking Democrat in the Kansas Senate. She has championed public school funding, Medicaid expansion, early childhood education, and protections for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking.\n\nFor Insurance Commissioner, Sykes has pledged to not accept 'a single dime from the insurance industry' — a direct contrast with her opponent Daniel Hawkins, who spent 30 years in the insurance business. She has secured bipartisan endorsements from BOTH former Kansas Insurance Commissioners: Democrat Kathleen Sebelius and Republican Sandy Praeger. Her platform focuses on lowering insurance costs for families and holding big insurance companies accountable.\n\nThe race against Hawkins is considered genuinely competitive — especially after Hawkins used his Speaker power to block the prescription drug pricing bill SB 360, only to be overruled 104-17 by his own Republican caucus. Sykes' party-switch story, bipartisan endorsements, and the SB 360 debacle give her a real path to victory in a race that would otherwise favor Republicans.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Switched from Republican to Democrat in December 2018 along with three other female Kansas legislators — a coordinated defection that made national news.",
      "First woman to serve as Kansas Senate Minority Leader.",
      "Pledged zero insurance industry campaign contributions — a direct contrast with opponent Hawkins who spent 30 years in the insurance industry.",
      "Endorsed by BOTH former Insurance Commissioners: Democrat Kathleen Sebelius AND Republican Sandy Praeger — a rare bipartisan endorsement for the very office she's seeking.",
      "Attended Trevecca Nazarene University (Church of the Nazarene affiliated) and lives in Lenexa where the denomination's international headquarters is located.",
      "Started her political career as a PTA President frustrated with school budget cuts — went from 'shy kid' to Senate Minority Leader.",
      "Having BOTH a Democratic and Republican former Insurance Commissioner endorse you is extraordinary. Praeger's endorsement in particular is a powerful signal that Sykes has genuine crossover appeal and that the \"moderate Republican\" wing of Kansas politics sees her as credible",
      "On her party switch: \"I am a moderate person who represents a moderate and pragmatic district... being a moderate inside the Republican Party is an increasingly difficult path to take with the trajectory of the party nationally.\" (December 2018, multiple sources)"

He grew up in Hays, attended TMP-Marian, and later returned to work in Catholic school advancement after earlier work in county environmental services and local food service management. That mix of nonprofit, school, and city work shows up repeatedly in his public roles and makes him one of the more institutionally embedded figures in Hays.\n\nHis career also maps onto the city's biggest policy fights. He has been one of the most visible commissioners on water supply, housing, downtown placemaking, airport funding, and the city's long-running R9 Ranch project. Public coverage also shows him moving quickly from commissioner to vice mayor and then mayor, which suggests he is both politically ambitious and broadly trusted by the current commission majority.\n\nMason Ruder is the mayor of Hays and a member of the city commission. The city's official commission page lists him as mayor, and Hays Catholic Schools describes him as a 2010 Thomas More Prep-Marian graduate who serves as director of institutional advancement. The public record ties him closely to Hays' Catholic and civic infrastructure, not just municipal politics.\n\nEllis County Environmental Services (~2017-2022, 5 years) -- Rose to Environmental Services Director. Oversaw adoption of county's new Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Regulations. Presented 2021 Solid Waste/Transfer Station Annual Report. Led unified effort to revitalize the Extra Territorial Jurisdiction of the City of Hays for smart growth for the next 50+ years.",

    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "This is as deeply embedded in Catholic life as it gets at the local level. Mason Ruder does not just attend -- he works for the Catholic schools, graduated from the Catholic high school, and is a parish member. His faith is clearly central to his identity and career. Whether he is active in Knights of Columbus (Council #6984 meets at IHM) was not confirmed in public records but would be worth asking directly",
      "Ruder is the youngest and most politically ambitious commissioner. CPM credential, political leadership degree, and advancement director role all suggest a person building toward higher office. His sole \"no\" vote on the mask mandate is notable -- it positions him as the most conservative-leaning commissioner on that issue. The 9/11 editorial through the Kansas Press Association shows he is cultivating a public voice beyond Hays. The Youth Leadership Advisory Board is a genuine legacy initiative",

    "whoTheyAre": "Alaina Cunningham is the Vice Mayor of Hays and the least publicly visible member of the city commission. She is a Registered Nurse and ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor at HaysMed's Center for Health Improvement. Originally from Dodge City, she moved to Hays around 2010 — reportedly for her husband's career.\n\nCunningham was not originally elected to the commission — she was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Michael Berges when he left to join the Ellis County Commission in late 2022. She then won election in her own right in November 2023 to a four-year term. She was elected Vice Mayor by her fellow commissioners in January 2026.\n\nOutside city government, Cunningham has served as President of the HaysMed Foundation board for 8+ years and sat on the Downtown Hays Development Corporation board. Her community involvement centers on healthcare, fitness, and civic engagement. She has publicly focused on fiscal responsibility and sustainable growth. No church or faith affiliation has been found in any public record — her candidate profiles, HaysPost Q&As, and social media contain no faith references. She shares the Cunningham surname with County Attorney Aaron Cunningham, but the family relationship has not been confirmed despite investigation.",
    "theirRecord": "Appointed to the Hays City Commission to fill the unexpired Berges seat, then elected to a full term in 2023.\n\nElevated to vice mayor in January 2026 when the commission reorganized.\n\nFocused publicly on the city's sustainable water supply, housing shortage, youth retention, and support for retirees.\n\nSupported development incentives and financing tools meant to keep Hays attractive to builders and businesses.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "The complete absence of faith references in any public profile is notable. This does not mean she is not a churchgoer -- many local officials simply do not publicize their church life. However, in a community as church-centric as Hays, the silence is itself a data point. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Cunningham is the least publicly visible commissioner. She was appointed (not initially elected), has limited news quotes, and her community profile is primarily through HaysMed Foundation and PTA work rather than political activity. Her LinkedIn describes her as a \"Health and Well-being professional.\" Her appointment filled a vacancy, and she won her first election in 2023. As Vice Mayor, she's positioned as Ruder's second-in-command",

      "Cunningham remains the least publicly visible commissioner. Her primary public identity is through healthcare (HaysMed nurse) and community boards rather than political activity.

He works as an account representative for Nex-Tech, managing IT, cybersecurity, physical security, and communications. His wife Heather is an instructor in the FHSU Department of Teacher Education (previously a Hays Middle School teacher).\n\nMusil and his wife Heather co-owned the Paisley Pear Wine Bar, Bistro and Market in downtown Hays from 2017 until selling the business in October 2024. The Paisley Pear won a Kansas SBDC award and FHSU Tiger Nation Partner of the Year in 2024. He also ran on GoodParty.org, a nonpartisan political platform, suggesting an independent orientation.\n\nMusil served as Mayor of Hays during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. During that period, his family's vehicles were vandalized after he voted FOR the city's mask ordinance. His entire family subsequently contracted COVID. Despite the threats and personal cost, Musil has said the mask vote was the right call and that he was 'scared to death' but stood by it. He was re-elected in November 2025 to a four-year term through 2029 — an emphatic community endorsement after a decade of service. No church or faith affiliation has been publicly identified despite 30 years of residence in Hays.",
    "theirRecord": "Re-elected in 2025 for another city commission term after more than a decade in office.\n\nRepeatedly framed the R9 water project as unfinished business and a generational necessity.\n\nBacked RHID and housing policy changes that he says have increased the number of houses being built.\n\nHas pressed for retail growth and a stronger sales-tax base as part of the city's broader financial health.",

      "30 years in Hays with zero public faith references is the most telling absence on this list. He may attend church privately, but faith does not appear to be part of his public identity or decision-making framework. The wine bar ownership is not inherently relevant but does distinguish him from officials who lead with faith credentials. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Musil is the most experienced commissioner and the institutional backbone of the commission. 12+ years of service spanning COVID, the R9 water fight, housing crisis, and downtown revitalization. His COVID leadership -- standing by the mask mandate despite vandalism and threats to his family -- is the most dramatic personal story on the commission. The Paisley Pear ownership creates an interesting lens on his downtown development votes, though nothing improper has been alleged. He ran on GoodParty.org, suggesting nonpartisan/independent orientation",
      "Hays Post: Commission reorganized, Musil thankful",
      "Musil is entering his final years on the commission with deep institutional memory. The COVID vandalism story is the most dramatic personal narrative of any local official in Hays. Having sold the Paisley Pear, he's now free of the business interest that created potential conflict-of-interest questions on downtown development votes. His re-election in 2025 to a four-year term (through 2029) was emphatic community endorsement",

She retired from a long banking career at Sunflower Bank where she served as Executive Vice President, then served as Executive Director of the Heartland Community Foundation for 5 years before retiring around December 31, 2020.\n\nJacobs has served approximately 8 years on the city commission and has been elected Mayor three times (2021, 2024, 2025). She was re-elected in November 2025 to a four-year term that will carry her to age 79. She voted FOR the mask mandate during COVID alongside Shaun Musil.\n\nHer signature legacy is the Vine Street corridor — she ran on 'fix Vine Street,' championed the construction of roundabouts, and proudly cites 10-20% increases in restaurant sales near the roundabouts as evidence of her vision. She has said 'I am very focused on retail development in this community.' No church or faith affiliation has been publicly identified despite being a lifetime Hays resident.",
    "theirRecord": "Re-elected in 2025 and returned to office for another term.\n\nServed as Hays mayor before the 2026 reorganization, when Mason Ruder was chosen as mayor and Alaina Cunningham as vice mayor.\n\nHas pushed the R9 project for years and repeatedly treated it as the city's top long-term water issue.\n\nBacked housing and incentive-district policy changes while defending revenue-neutral budgeting and a conservative tax posture.",

      "Jacobs is the elder statesperson of the commission. At 75, she's a retired banker and nonprofit executive who has served three stints as mayor. Her Vine Street roundabout campaign is her most tangible infrastructure legacy -- and she's not shy about citing the economic impact data. Her retail development focus aligns with a business-oriented worldview shaped by decades in banking and economic development. She voted with the mask mandate majority. Her re-election in November 2025 to another four-year term (through 2029, when she'd be 79) shows she isn't slowing down",
      "Hays Post: Jacobs filing announcement",
      "At 75, Jacobs is the commission's elder stateswoman with the deepest roots in Hays finance and philanthropy. Her Sunflower Bank career (EVP) and Heartland Foundation leadership give her the strongest economic development credentials on the commission. The Vine Street roundabout project -- backed by hard data on restaurant sales increases -- is a tangible legacy. She and Danny are emblematic of the \"establishment Hays\" power structure: banking, nonprofit, civic service",

    "whoTheyAre": "David Vilaysing, 43, is a retired Hays Police Department sergeant with 19 years of law enforcement service plus military police experience — 22 years total in LE/MP. After retiring from the force, he founded DXI Training Solutions LLC, a veteran-owned company that provides de-escalation training, tactical communication, self-defense courses, and first responder training. He is a member of ILEETA (International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association) and runs 'Be Your Own Bodyguard' self-defense courses. He also fundraises for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nVilaysing was elected to the Hays City Commission in November 2025 on a two-year term, defeating Reese Barrick — the commission's most progressive member, who had participated in 'No Kings' protests. Vilaysing's election shifted the commission rightward. His first initiative as commissioner was asking city staff to review pet licensing requirements, noting the program costs $14,000 per year in fees while most owners already buy their own tags. No church or faith affiliation has been publicly identified.",
    "theirRecord": "Elected to the Hays City Commission in 2025 on a platform centered on water, housing, and city transparency.\n\nEntered office with a background in police budgets, training, and frontline city operations.\n\nSaid he wants a permanent water solution and better public visibility into the R9 process.\n\nHas stressed low- and middle-income housing and a desire to help make Hays more livable for working families.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "The \"core values\" language is suggestive but not conclusive. His background is law enforcement and military -- both communities where faith can be deeply held but not publicly displayed. No specific church identified. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Vilaysing is the wild card on the commission. A 19-year police veteran with military police background, he's the only commissioner with law enforcement experience. His DXI Training business shows he's focused on de-escalation and communication -- not the stereotypical \"tough cop\" persona. The Alzheimer's fundraiser and BYOB self-defense classes show community engagement. His Laotian surname suggests an interesting personal story (likely refugee family background given the Laotian community in Kansas), though no details were found in public records. His pet licensing initiative is a small but telling first move -- he's looking to cut bureaucratic friction. He replaced the most progressive commissioner (Barrick, the No Kings protester), which shifts the commission's ideological center",

      "Vilaysing brings a unique perspective to the commission as a Laotian-American retired police sergeant with military police background. His de-escalation focus (both professionally and philosophically) is notable -- he's not a \"tough on crime\" stereotype. The BYOB self-defense classes and Alzheimer's fundraiser show genuine community investment. His pet licensing reform initiative (reducing bureaucratic fees that collect only $14K/year) signals a practical, libertarian-leaning approach to government. He replaced the progressive Reese Barrick, shifting the commission's center of gravity",

    "whoTheyAre": "Toby Dougherty is the most powerful person in Hays city government — and he is not elected. He has served as City Manager since August 1, 2007, and was Assistant City Manager starting March 2005, giving him 21 years of continuous service running the city. Commissioners rotate through; Dougherty is the constant.\n\nDougherty is a University of Kansas Political Science graduate who spent 12 years in the transportation industry before entering municipal government. He previously served as City Administrator of Gallatin, Missouri. His salary is $186,284 (as of 2022). He completed the KU Certified Public Manager program. In December 2024, he appointed Jarrod Kuckelman as Assistant City Manager — widely seen as grooming a potential successor.\n\nDougherty's signature project is the R9 Ranch Water Pipeline — a $144.9 million, 65-90 mile pipeline from Edwards County to Hays that represents the city's long-term water sustainability plan. The city purchased the ranch in 1995 and filed a change-of-use application in 2015, which has been in litigation through the Kansas Supreme Court. Dougherty secured a $15.8 million Build Kansas grant for the project. He is also known as the architect of Hays becoming the 'California of Kansas' — leading the city to reduce water usage by one-third through cash-for-grass programs, low-flow requirements, a recycled water plant, and landscaping regulations borrowed from Utah. He was one of the first city managers in the country to adopt Strong Towns fiscal analysis methodology. In 19 years, zero personal controversies have been found — remarkable for any public official. No church or faith affiliation has been publicly identified.",
    "theirRecord": "Has been city manager since 2007 and previously served as assistant city manager.\n\nHelped steer the city through R9 water planning, water conservation measures, and repeated legal challenges over the transfer.\n\nOversaw budget discussions where the city emphasized maintenance rather than expansion in 2026.\n\nLed or explained major public works items such as water meter replacement, street maintenance, and airport lighting upgrades.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "As an appointed manager rather than elected official, Dougherty may deliberately keep personal faith private to maintain professional neutrality. 19+ years in Hays without a single public faith reference is notable but may be by professional design. Less relevant for Elect Righteous since he is not elected",
      "Toby Dougherty is the most powerful person in Hays city government. Commissioners serve 2-4 year terms and rotate through the mayor position; Dougherty has been the constant for 19 years. He runs the daily operations, prepares the budgets, hires the staff, and manages every major project. The R9 water project is his legacy bet -- a $145M infrastructure project that will define whether Hays survives as a viable western Kansas city in the 21st century. His Strong Towns philosophy is intellectually interesting and somewhat at odds with the aggressive growth incentives the commission has been approving (RHIDs, IRBs, Chick-fil-A incentives). His 12-year prior career in transportation before city management gives him infrastructure chops. His KU political science background and CPM credential match Mason Ruder's -- suggesting he may have been a mentor/model for Ruder's career path. 19 years with no significant personal controversies is remarkable for any public official",
      "City of Hays: City Manager's Office",
      "Dougherty is the most consequential unelected official in western Kansas. His 21-year tenure managing a city whose water supply is existentially threatened has made him effectively irreplaceable. The R9 Ranch pipeline is a generational infrastructure project -- $144.9M for a city of 21,000 is extraordinary. His Strong Towns methodology makes him unusually sophisticated for a small-city manager. The cost doubling of the R9 project is his biggest vulnerability, but no one has seriously challenged it because everyone knows the alternative (no water) is unthinkable. His personal privacy is remarkable -- in 21 years, there's essentially nothing public about his personal life",

He rose from reserve deputy work in 1995 to deputy, narcotics detective, undersheriff, and then sheriff, while earning a Certified Public Manager designation and the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center credential. The current official sheriff page also identifies him as president of the Kansas Sheriffs' Association, which makes him one of the more publicly visible county officials in western Kansas.",

He is visible in school coverage, county office materials, and Hays Post reporting, which together show a local who left for college and law school and then came back. The county attorney office page now lists him as the officeholder from 2025 onward, and the Hays High Guidon profile captures the career-speaker version of the same story: a student who was active in music and clubs and who later found his lane in advocacy and law.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Bobbi Dreiling, 61, is the Ellis County Clerk and Election Officer — the person who runs elections in Ellis County. A Hays native, she holds an associate's degree from Hutchinson Community College and served 8 years as Deputy Clerk under predecessor Donna Maskus before winning election in 2020. She was re-elected in 2024 with 77% of the vote despite a controversy over a campus polling location. Her salary is $86,840 plus a $10,000 election stipend.\n\nDreiling was the first Ellis County clerk to prepare revenue-neutral rate mailings — state-mandated tax transparency notifications that show citizens exactly how much their property taxes will change. She implemented Saturday early voting, text and email election notifications, and secured a $6,000 grant to install cameras at the ballot drop box that capture the vehicle, driver, and ballot count.\n\nHer most notable controversy involved closing a campus-adjacent polling location near Fort Hays State University, arguing only 69 students were registered to vote on campus out of 1,650 residents. The ACLU launched a campaign against the closure and gathered a 480-signature petition, but Dreiling won re-election 77-23% anyway. During her tenure as deputy clerk in 2020, 3,800 ballots were misprinted (though this occurred under the previous clerk). Two incorrect ballots were also issued in a 2025 school bond election. The Dreiling surname is a well-established German-Catholic Ellis County family name.",
    "theirRecord": "As clerk/election officer, Dreiling focused on voter turnout logistics, advance voting, assisted-living voting access, and election security.\n\nShe was publicly praised by county Republicans in 2024 for the administration of the election cycle and by critics in the Hays campus polling-place debate.\n\nKansas Ethics records for a county Republican committee show support expenditures tied to her race, including a $999 text broadcast and a $50 meeting-room rental.\n\nCounty office page confirms her office title and contact information.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Dreiling is one of the few county officials whose public identity is tightly tied to election administration rather than general government",
      "The public record shows she was not a novice: she had eight years inside the clerk’s office before running",
      "Her office is central to advance voting, ADA access, and election security",
      "County office page confirms her office title and contact information",
      "Kansas Register of Deeds Association contact listing corroborates the office ecosystem around county recordkeeping",
      "The ACLU of Kansas publicly criticized the county’s poll-location handling, which is relevant context for her public record",
      "Bobbi Dreiling was devoutly Catholic by her own family's account. The Dreiling name is as German-Catholic Ellis County as it gets -- this family literally hosted the first Catholic services in what became Antonino. NOTE: She passed away in October 2024, so this position may have been filled by appointment. Verify who currently holds the County Clerk position",
      "Dreiling is an election administrator in an era when election administration is intensely politicized. Her refusal to place a polling location at FHSU -- despite formal petitions from students, the ACLU, university administration, and campus police -- is her most controversial decision. The \"69 registered voters on campus\" defense ignores the broader population of students who live off-campus but near FHSU. Her election security camera installation and township consolidation show competent administration. The 3,800 misprinted ballots occurred on her watch as deputy clerk -- not directly her fault, but she was in the office when it happened. Her 77-23% re-election margin in 2024 shows the controversy hasn't cost her Republican voter support"

He is a 2004 graduate of Thomas More Prep-Marian — the Catholic high school in Hays — and his family is connected to St. Nicholas of Myra Catholic Church through obituary records of the Leiker family, one of the established German-Catholic families of Ellis County.\n\nLeiker was elected to the Ellis County Commission in 2022, winning a four-way Republican primary with 764 votes. He served as Commission Chairman in 2024 and is Vice Chairman in 2026. His salary is $20,746. He is known for his detailed approach to budgeting — he has said the commission spent 'almost 13 hours going through each department, item by item, justifying costs.'\n\nOutside county government, Leiker serves on the boards of the Kansas Hereford Association, Ellis County Farm Bureau, Cottonwood Extension District, and High Plains Mental Health. He has a LinkedIn profile confirming his agricultural business operations.",
    "theirRecord": "Leiker’s public positions are mostly policy preferences rather than formal roll-call votes.\n\nHe argued for a permanent sales tax, infrastructure earmarks, and stable business conditions.\n\nHe also backed equipment-sharing with municipalities, more transparency, and telecommunication expansion.\n\nEllis County’s commission page confirms the office context.",

      "LKM’s member directory publicly lists him in the county membership system",
      "The Hays Post profile captures unusually concrete positions on taxes, zoning, transparency, and equipment-sharing",
      "The family evidence is strong. The Leiker name in Ellis County is essentially synonymous with the German-Catholic heritage. His grandmother's funeral was at St. Nicholas of Myra. It would be surprising if Nathan Leiker were NOT Catholic, but personal confirmation was not found. Recommend direct inquiry",
      "Leiker is the agricultural voice on the commission -- a working farmer managing 2,000+ acres across two counties. His TMP-Marian background places him squarely in the Catholic Volga German community that is the cultural bedrock of Ellis County. His 2022 primary win over the incumbent (who finished last in a four-way race) suggests the rural agricultural community wanted fresh representation. His budget discipline (\"2 paychecks a year\") translates directly to his government approach -- during the 2026 budget, he noted the commission spent \"almost 13 hours going through each department, item by item, justifying costs and adjustments"

He is not a loud political figure, but he is responsible for a lot of the county's revenue workflow and motor-vehicle processing.",

His profile is anchored in local school governance, community volunteering, and church involvement, with his own comments stressing kids, family, and neighborhood ties. The additional round of checking did not surface any contradictory identity clues.\n\nBrooks is a long-serving USD 489 board member in Hays and a publicly identified leader in the Celebration Community Church Hays campus children's ministry. That combination of school-board service and church-service visibility makes him easy to distinguish from namesakes.\n\nKen Brooks is a Hays school-board incumbent and the district's current vice president. Public profiles identify him as a loss-control safety specialist at Insurance Planning, a Kiwanis member, and a long-time Hays parent whose three daughters graduated from Hays High.\n\nEmployed for 18+ years (as of 2025 election cycle).",
    "theirRecord": "Brooks' board record still centers on fee reductions, bond support, and a generally pro-administration posture on day-to-day management. In the public questionnaire trail, he has repeatedly argued that the district has been responsible with money and that the board should focus on broad oversight rather than micromanagement. The second-pass review did not uncover major controversies or flipped positions.\n\nThe second-pass review reinforced the same core sources: Hays Post candidate coverage, the USD 489 board portal, KSDE directory listings, and Celebration Community Church materials. I did not find court, property, or business-record material that changed the profile.\n\nBrooks' public record is centered on facilities, fees, and budget stewardship. He supported the 2017 bond, later ran on keeping the current bond work on pace, and said the district has done a good job finding ways to fund immediate facility concerns. In 2025 he said he wanted to keep lowering student enrollment fees, and he defended district budgeting as responsible and trustworthy.\n\nHe also favors a board that governs without micromanaging. In his 2025 Q&A, he said the board should provide oversight while leaving day-to-day operations to administrators and teachers, and he specifically pointed to Superintendent Ron Wilson and the district finance team as people he trusts to answer budget questions. That makes Brooks a pragmatic, systems-and-process board member rather than an ideologue.",

    "whoTheyAre": "The broader record still portrays Vajnar as a district insider with unusually deep institutional memory. He is not only a former teacher but also a current board leader who has remained visible in facility planning, bond follow-through, and public discussion of long-range capital work. The second pass did not surface any contradictory biographical facts.\n\nVajnar is the board president and a long-time USD 489 educator, publicly described as having taught in the district for 31 years. The school-board role, teaching history, and local Catholic reference are enough to distinguish him clearly from any namesake.\n\nCurt Vajnar is the current USD 489 board president, a retired Hays teacher, rancher, and business owner. His public biography says he taught for 31 years in USD 489, won Kansas Teacher of the Year, and has lived in Hays for 35 years.\n\nVajnar taught agriculture education at Hays High School for 31 years. He was named Kansas Teacher of the Year by KNEA -- the youngest teacher to win that honor at the time. He was also the only nationally board-certified agriculture teacher in the state. He had teaching endorsements in Agriculture Education, Biology, Drivers Education, and Administration. He chose never to pursue an administrator role despite holding the certificate. Retired around 2020.",
    "theirRecord": "His public priorities remain facilities completion and long-term planning. He repeatedly argued for a 10-year facilities plan instead of a five-year horizon, framing the issue as business-like stewardship and a way to stretch bond and naming-rights dollars. He appears to be one of the district's key agenda-shapers because he also serves as board president.\n\nThe second-pass sweep kept pointing back to the same core sources: Hays Post profile coverage, the USD 489 board portal, KSDE directory references, and the old Knights of Columbus newsletter mention. I did not find any court, property, or business records that materially changed the profile.\n\nVajnar has been one of the clearest board voices on capital planning. He told Hays Post he wants a 10-year facilities plan because the district has several turf and facility replacements with overlapping warranty cycles. He also wants naming-rights revenue to go back into replacement reserves rather than into the general fund, which is a very specific stewardship philosophy.\n\nHe has been broadly supportive of the bond buildout and says the work should be finished well rather than rushed. In later board coverage he also showed up as a steady vote for operations like transportation leasing and building improvements, and the district directory lists him as board president. He reads as a process-and-maintenance board member, not a culture-war board member.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Vajnar's school-board influence is amplified by the fact that he is the board president",
      "His public messaging is about long-horizon planning, not short-term fixes",

      "He taught in USD 489 for 31 years and won Kansas Teacher of the Year",
      "He wants a 10-year plan, not just a five-year plan, for facilities",

The second-pass review did not uncover any identity conflicts.\n\nRuder is a Hays native, Hays High graduate, and USD 489 board member whose public biography centers on local finance work at Golden Plains Credit Union. That combination makes her identity easy to verify and distinct from any same-name person.\n\nRuth A. Ruder is a Hays-born USD 489 graduate, vice president at Golden Plains Credit Union, and a current USD 489 board member. The district portal lists her as a board member, and her public profile shows deep local roots.\n\nThe Mayor's office (Mason).",

She has supported technology and classroom-oriented spending while also asking hard questions about whether land transactions or sponsorships create real benefit for the district. Her comments in the land-sale coverage showed a willingness to slow down when public purpose was not clear.\n\nThe second pass reinforced her Hays High and Golden Plains background and the district board portal record. I also checked for additional public-record angles such as property, court, and archived social content, but nothing attributable enough surfaced to change the profile.\n\nRuder's public record on the board emphasizes communication, fiscal discipline, and a willingness to slow down when land use or spending choices could have long-term consequences. In December 2025 she voiced concern that a buyer of district land next to the middle school might simply hold it for a tax deduction rather than use it productively. In other votes, she supported laptop purchases for Hays High and said students should be at the center of the district's decisions.\n\nShe is also a board voice who cares about the district's reputation as a community asset. In her election profile she said USD 489 can be \"the highlight of our community\" and that the district should balance smart growth with fiscal responsibility. Her comments on sponsorships and land sales show a board member who is comfortable asking what the public gets back for a given dollar.",

    "whoTheyAre": "The public record keeps Yarmer in the lane of medically trained school-board oversight: he is the doctor on the board who keeps returning to core academics, student safety, and operational discipline. The second pass did not uncover identity confusion, and it reinforced that his public persona is unusually credentialed and locally rooted.\n\nYarmer is a practicing emergency physician and USD 489 board member whose biography is anchored in Albert, Otis-Bison, FHSU, KU, and UMKC. That full education-and-medical path is public enough to keep him distinct from any same-name physician.\n\nDerek Yarmer is a Hays USD 489 board member and an emergency medicine doctor. His public profile says he was raised in Albert, graduated from FHSU in chemistry, completed KU School of Medicine and UMKC residency training, and moved back to Hays in 2015 with his wife Emily.",
    "theirRecord": "Yarmer's board posture continues to read as skeptical but constructive. He supports school goals, but he repeatedly asks for more explanation when spending or process seems rushed, and he has voted no when he thought a purchase or commitment moved too quickly. His public comments about emergencies, core subjects, and extracurricular balance make him one of the clearest \"process first\" voices on the board.\n\nThe second-pass review continued to emphasize Hays Post profiles, the board portal, and the KSDE directory. I did not find court, property, or business records that added meaningful candidate-specific facts, and I did not find a verified faith source.\n\nYarmer has been one of the more skeptical voices on spending and process. He has said board decisions should be broadcast, agendas should come out earlier, and bond money should be spent responsibly. In 2025 he asked for bids on flooring and asbestos work to come to the board before a vote, saying that if everything is an emergency then nothing is an emergency.\n\nHe has also voted against some expenditures that other members supported, including furniture and other purchases where he wanted the board to be more deliberate. His public posture is not anti-school, but it is strongly pro-oversight. He reads like a board member who wants more explanation, more bidding, and more patience before large commitments.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Yarmer is the rare board member whose day job is directly tied to emergency decision-making",
      "He has a deep local-school-to-medical-school path that keeps him grounded in the region",

      "He is the only board member in this group who is also a practicing emergency physician",
      "His education path runs from Otis-Bison to FHSU to KU Med to UMKC",

He has the kind of institutional memory that comes from having watched the district through multiple staffing, facilities, and enrollment cycles. The additional review did not surface any identity ambiguity.\n\nPark is a retired educator and former Washington Elementary principal who has spent more than three decades inside USD 489. His family-of-educators background and long service history make him easy to verify in the public record.\n\nAllen Park is a retired USD 489 elementary principal, a licensed insurance agent, and a current USD 489 board member. Public profiles say he has worked in USD 489 for 31 years and is now also doing part-time UPS work.\n\nAllen Park served USD 489 for 31 years in multiple roles:.",
    "theirRecord": "Park's record still leans toward bond completion, careful process, and a steady interest in teacher retention and student outcomes. He has supported major facilities work but has also shown he is willing to vote no when he thinks purchases need more scrutiny. He appears to view his role as protecting public money while preserving educational quality.\n\nThe second-pass search kept reinforcing his school-district biography and the public board portal. I did not uncover any court, property, or business records that materially changed the public profile.\n\nPark is one of the clearest supporters of the bond-buildout phase and the district's effort to lower student fees. He told Hays Post that the bond is replacing and repairing facilities, more teachers have been hired, and reduced fees help families in tight times. He also repeatedly says communication and transparency are what build trust with stakeholders.\n\nHis more recent board coverage shows him willing to question spending that he thinks is too fast or too expensive. In 2025 he voted against some furniture purchases, and he has been willing to pause or delay decisions when he wants more review. He is not a reflexive \"yes\" vote; he is a long-term district steward who likes structured process.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [

Her public comments and background keep emphasizing family life, classroom experience, and a very local sense of responsibility to students. I did not find conflicting identity data.\n\nGoetz is a lifelong Hays resident, FHSU math instructor, and USD 489 board member. Her public trail also places her in the district as a former Hays High teacher, which makes the identity match straightforward.\n\nJayme Goetz is a lifelong Hays resident, Fort Hays State mathematics instructor, and current USD 489 board member. Her public profile says she grew up in Hays, earned three degrees from Fort Hays State, and returned to teach here after one year in Ellsworth.",
    "theirRecord": "Goetz remains one of the board's more transparency-focused voices. She has raised questions about handbook rules, compensation, laptop spending, and policy clarity, and she has framed those questions in terms of how decisions land on real families. The record suggests active oversight rather than passive consensus.\n\nThe second pass kept pointing back to Hays Post, the USD 489 board portal, and the educational background already in the file. I did not find court, property, or archived social sources that changed the profile in a verifiable way.\n\nGoetz has repeatedly pushed the board toward better communication, clearer discipline policy, and more transparent budget decisions. In 2025 she asked how the 2.5 percent raise figure was calculated, and she pushed the district to clarify handbook discipline rules so families know the consequences. She also supported laptops for Hays High students after hearing from teachers who preferred them.\n\nShe has a visible habit of asking the board to slow down and explain itself. That showed up in the handbook fight, in questions about capital purchases, and in her insistence that the district's decisions should be understandable to the families who pay for them. She is not a passive member; she is an asking-questions member.",

In later coverage he came back to the board with the same eye toward continuity and student experience.\n\nHe also tends to favor steady, operational problem-solving.

I did not find any church, property, or court source that changed the public profile.\n\nWilson's record is the bond era itself. He has been the public face of Roosevelt and Hays High construction, the district's capital outlay plan, and the ongoing maintenance work that still has to happen after the ribbon cuttings. He has also spoken out when state or federal decisions threaten district funding, including title grant delays and other budget pressures.\n\nBecause he is the superintendent, the board mostly evaluates him through implementation: facility delivery, staffing, budget management, and communications. The public record shows him as a steady advocate for the district's large capital projects and as the person who keeps those projects moving once the board votes.",
    "whatYouShouldKnow": [
      "Wilson is the administrative engine behind the district's major capital projects",
      "His public role is to explain and implement rather than vote",
      "He consistently pushes the district toward better facilities and long-term planning",
      "He is the district superintendent, so he is the top administrator",
      "He is the public face of the bond and facility work",
      "He has pushed the district to build schools that are better than the ones it had",
      "The second pass kept returning to the board portal, KSDE directory listing, Hays Post coverage, and the handbook material already in the file. I did not find any church, property, or court source that changed the public profile",
      "As a superintendent, Wilson may deliberately avoid public faith statements to maintain neutrality. His comment on the dress code controversy was notably secular in framing. Not elected, so less relevant for Elect Righteous. Recommend direct inquiry if desired"
