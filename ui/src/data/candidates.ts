  // Article body
  whoTheyAre: `Tracey Robert Mann, born December 17, 1976, is a fifth-generation Kansas farmer from Quinter who became a commercial real estate broker in Salina before entering politics. He grew up on the family's Gove County farm — an operation still active today — and attended Kansas State University, earning a B.S. in Business Administration before returning to western Kansas to work the land and build a real estate career.

Mann first entered public life when he won a seat in the Kansas Senate in 2009, representing Senate District 36. After a narrow loss in the 2010 Republican primary for the KS-01 congressional seat, he returned to private business for nearly a decade. He re-entered the congressional race in 2020, won the Republican primary, and defeated Democrat Kali Barnett in the general election with 67% of the vote. He has since been re-elected in 2022 and 2024 by similar margins, cementing KS-01 as among the most reliably Republican districts in the nation.

Before entering Congress, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values — a Washington-based faith leadership program. He and his wife Audra have four children and live in Quinter. His congressional biography foregrounds his farming identity and stated commitment to rural Kansas values.`,

  theirRecord: `Mann serves on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His tenure has centered on four areas: agricultural policy, including the Farm Bill and crop insurance programs; border security legislation; energy production and opposition to green energy mandates; and fiscal conservatism, including opposition to large spending packages. Heritage Action rates him at 96%, placing him among the most conservative members of the House.

On January 6–7, 2021, Mann voted to object to certifying Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes, citing "election integrity" concerns. This vote placed him among the 147 House Republicans who maintained their objections even after the Capitol breach earlier that day. Mann has defended the vote in subsequent constituent communications, framing it as responding to voter concerns rather than endorsing the attack.

Mann also voted against the bipartisan ROTOR Act — legislation that would have expanded drone delivery infrastructure in rural areas. The bill had support from agricultural organizations and rural broadband advocates, and its failure drew criticism from rural development groups. Mann has not offered detailed public comment on the vote.

Key legislation Mann has supported includes the Secure the Border Act, the REIN IN Inflation Act, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and the Energy Independence and Security Act. He has consistently voted against large omnibus spending packages and opposed expanded federal social programs.`,

  whatYouShouldKnow: [
    "Voted against certifying Arizona AND Pennsylvania's electoral votes on January 6, 2021 — one of 147 House Republicans to do so after the Capitol breach that same day.",
    "The only member of the Kansas congressional delegation to vote against the ROTOR Act, bipartisan legislation that would have expanded drone delivery routes in rural and agricultural communities.",
    "56.71% of his campaign funding comes from PACs — with only 0.72% from small-dollar donors (under $200). The majority of his individual grassroots support comes from larger donors.",
    "His single largest donor category is the Crop Production industry ($197,200), representing large agricultural input corporations — chemical, seed, and fertilizer companies — rather than individual family farmers.",
    "He served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values prior to Congress — a faith-based leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C.",
  ],

  whereTheyWorship: `Mann attends First Covenant Church in Salina, Kansas, affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church denomination — a theologically centrist Protestant tradition with roots in Swedish pietism. Before his congressional career, Mann served as Senior Program Director for the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values, a Washington-based nonprofit that runs faith-oriented leadership programs for high school and college students. His public statements frequently invoke faith as a personal anchor, though he does not typically make church policy a campaign centerpiece.`,

He was born in El Dorado in 1960, grew up in a fifth-generation Kansas farm family, and moved to Great Bend in 1991 after medical training. Over the course of his OB-GYN career, he delivered more than 5,000 babies before entering politics. Marshall's public biography combines medicine, agriculture, and church life. He and his wife Laina have been married more than 40 years, and their family life has long been tied to Great Bend. Before the Senate, he represented Kansas's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House, and he remains one of the few Kansas politicians whose public profile is simultaneously local, statewide, and national.",
    "theirRecord": "Marshall's Senate record is built around conservative positions on health care, abortion, immigration, spending, and COVID policy. He sits on major committees including Agriculture, Finance, HELP, and Budget, and he has used that platform to stay visible in both farm-state policy fights and national conservative media disputes. Two parts of that record are especially significant. First, he voted to object to the 2020 presidential election certification on January 6, 2021, putting him among the Republicans who continued to challenge electoral votes after the Capitol attack. Second, he has repeatedly drawn attention for a combative public style, including his clashes with Dr. Anthony Fauci and his March 2025 Oakley town hall, where he left early and later said the crowd included \"paid agitators.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Jason Hart is a Wichita lawyer and former federal prosecutor running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026. His public biography is built around more than two decades in prosecution, including work in Dodge City, the Shawnee County District Attorney's office, the Kansas Attorney General's office, and 16 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Kansas. Hart entered the race in March 2026 after leaving his federal post. That made him one of the latest entrants in the field, but also one of the most unusual. He launched with a law-and-order résumé, a deliberate pitch to disaffected Republicans, and a party-history story that drew immediate attention. That party-history story is central to his profile. Hart had been registered as an independent, changed to Republican in February 2026 while considering a run against Rep. Ron Estes, and then changed to Democrat in March 2026 when he entered the Senate race. He has described the decision to run as the product of prayerful and tearful discussions with his wife and family.",
    "theirRecord": "Hart does not have a legislative record, so his public record is mostly his work as a prosecutor and the circumstances of his campaign launch. The most prominent credential in the raw material is his 16-year tenure as an assistant U.S. attorney handling child exploitation and cybercrime cases under both Republican and Democratic administrations. His candidacy has been shaped as much by rhetoric as by résumé. Kansas Reflector reported that Hart has openly courted Republicans who feel estranged from the current GOP, and he has argued that Kansas Democrats need a candidate who can draw those voters rather than just consolidate the party base. That argument has also created controversy inside the Democratic field. Hart publicly described himself as a \"white, male, Christian, hetero, 2A-friendly, LEO-friendly\" candidate, presenting those traits as part of his electability case in Kansas. Supporters can read that as blunt realism; critics can read it as a narrow theory of representation.",

He was born in Overland Park, graduated from Tufts University in 2013, and served on the USS Ronald Reagan, with the Joint Special Operations Task Force in the Arabian Peninsula, and at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C. Schmidt entered the Kansas Senate in January 2025 after winning District 19 in 2024. That makes him the only current elected officeholder in the Democratic Senate field. His public biography leans heavily on military service, family roots, and a Kansas identity tied to teachers, farmers, and small-town work rather than celebrity or outsider branding.",
    "theirRecord": "Schmidt's legislative record is still short, but it is already more concrete than most of the Democratic Senate field. In Topeka he has made property tax relief one of his signature issues and broke with many Democrats to support a constitutional amendment that would cap annual property-value increases for tax purposes. He also sponsored Senate Resolution 1706 condemning the pardons and commutations for people involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. His military background is not just biographical decoration in this race. Schmidt has said witnessing the aftermath of January 6 while stationed in Washington helped push him toward politics, and he presents himself as someone trying to connect national-security experience with Kansas governance. That gives him a public record built on service, an identifiable issue portfolio, and a clearer governing profile than candidates whose Senate runs are their first real test in office.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Christy Cauble Davis is a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate from Cottonwood Falls and one of the few contenders in the field with a long résumé in rural development work. She is a fifth-generation Kansan who graduated from Sedgwick High School, earned a bachelor's degree from Kansas State University in 1997, and completed a graduate degree at Wichita State University in 1999. Davis spent much of her career in historic preservation and small-town development. She worked as a preservation planner for the City of Newton, served as a preservation officer at the Kansas Historical Society, and later became executive director of Symphony in the Flint Hills after moving to Chase County in 2013. Public profiles also identify her as the owner of Davis Preservation, LLC. She and her husband, Luke Davis, renovated historic buildings in Cottonwood Falls, including a laundromat project and a former bank building converted into housing and a bookstore. Her highest-profile job came in federal government. Davis served as Kansas state director of USDA Rural Development from 2023 until January 2025, an office that she says oversaw more than $1.3 billion in investment across Kansas communities.",
    "theirRecord": "Davis's record is defined less by roll-call votes than by programs and projects. At USDA Rural Development, she became the public face of housing, infrastructure, healthcare, and business financing programs across the state. The source material says her office oversaw more than $1.3 billion in Kansas investments and worked on a broader push to cut red tape in how federal programs reached communities. Before that federal appointment, Davis built a reputation in preservation and civic development circles rather than in elected office. Her work at Symphony in the Flint Hills and her building rehabilitation projects in Cottonwood Falls fit the same pattern as her Senate pitch: invest in towns that are often overlooked and treat rural Kansas as a place worth building, not just defending rhetorically. She also has prior campaign history. Davis ran in the 2020 Democratic primary for Kansas's 1st Congressional District and lost to Kali Barnett, so her Senate campaign is not her first appearance on a statewide or federal ballot.",

Her professional life spans about 40 years, including 22 years as an executive at Ameriprise Financial Services. Spidel Neumann's campaign is built around experience in business and finance rather than a public-office resume. She returned to Kansas after years away, retired from Ameriprise in 2025, and entered the Senate race arguing that her management background and economic experience would be useful in a state where Democrats have struggled for decades to win federal office.",

Her campaign says Roger Marshall's conduct in office, including the atmosphere around a western Kansas town hall, helped push her into the race. Her message has focused on health care costs, reproductive rights, Social Security, Medicare, the VA, and support for farmers. Her early financial filing is also part of the public record. It showed a serious launch by Democratic-primary standards, including a six-figure candidate loan.

    "whoTheyAre": "Erik Murray is a Kansas City, Kansas, developer and entrepreneur running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026. He was born at KU Med, grew up in Kansas City, Kansas, and has described himself as a local candidate returning home after years in California business and investment work. Murray's public identity is tied most strongly to development. The centerpiece is the proposed redevelopment of the former Indian Springs Mall site in Wyandotte County, a large mixed-use plan that has been described in public reporting as a billion-dollar effort built around housing, retail, childcare, job training, transit access, and other community uses. He has never held elected office. His case for office is that a developer who has worked with lenders, investors, and local governments can better connect federal policy to neighborhood outcomes, especially for small businesses and distressed communities.",
    "theirRecord": "Murray's record is not a legislative one. It is a business and redevelopment record, and the largest public project attached to his name is the Indian Springs plan in Kansas City, Kansas. The project has been promoted as a major reinvestment proposal for the east side of the city, but it has also been slowed by disputes with the Unified Government over land price, financing, and project terms. Those negotiations became part of Murray's political profile in 2026. KSHB reported that the developer and the Unified Government remained far apart on key terms, and Murray publicly argued that taxpayers deserved more transparency about the stalled talks. That turned a local development fight into one of the clearest public tests of his management style. Murray has also drawn attention for how he talks about politics and capital. Kansas Reflector reported that he became attuned to the disconnect between what capital wants and what communities want, and later national conservative coverage highlighted his comments about the influence of former Black Panther leader Elaine Brown. That made him one of the more unusual biographies in the Democratic field: part developer, part civic-reinvestment candidate, and part culture-war target.",

She was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, raised in White Hall, and studied at Lyon College before earning her law degree at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2011. She later moved to Kansas through marriage and built a practice focused on immigration law. Parelkar has never held elected office. Her public biography is that of a lawyer and mother of two who says she sees the country's immigration machinery up close and believes Washington is failing both families and employers. In a crowded Democratic field, that professional specialty makes her more distinct than many first-time candidates.",
    "theirRecord": "Because she is a first-time candidate, Parelkar's record is rooted less in prior office than in the issues she has chosen to make central. She has argued that the immigration system is broken in practical ways, not just ideological ones, and she has paired that message with a proposal to replace the patchwork of Medicaid, CHIP, and other programs for minors with a single health-care program for people under 18. She has also called for stronger antitrust and consumer-protection laws. Her campaign grew partly out of frustration with constituent access. Public interviews say attending Marshall town halls helped convince her to run, and she has used transparency and responsiveness as a contrast point. The one clear controversy in the source file is procedural: she was named in an NRSC complaint over a late personal financial disclosure filing.",

His candidacy is historically notable because he is the first openly gay person to run for the Kansas Senate seat. At the same time, he is running a visibly lean campaign. His public web presence centers on a free Canva campaign site and an ActBlue page rather than a polished statewide operation. Soetaert's personal story is unusually public in some places and thin in others. Public sources say he was adopted into a Roman Catholic family and now identifies as Christian, but they do not identify a current church. His background matters because much of his campaign message is framed as a story of political and personal change rather than a long record of officeholding.",
    "theirRecord": "Soetaert's public record is less a story of long service in one office than of repeated candidacies and visible movement across the political spectrum. He previously ran in the 2020 Republican primary for Kansas's 1st Congressional District, served briefly on the Wellington City Council, and later entered the Democratic Senate race. His issue positions have also changed in public. Campaign materials and reporting show that he moved from an earlier anti-abortion position to a rights-based position after the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, summarizing that shift with the line, \"Kansans voted for bodily autonomy.\" He has also publicly supported the Respect for Marriage Act. That combination makes him one of the most unusual Democrats in the Senate field: a small-town candidate with Republican roots, a short local-government record, and a campaign centered as much on personal political evolution as on legislative accomplishments.",

His immediate trigger for running was political. McRoberts says he drove from Lawrence to Oakley for Roger Marshall's March 2025 town hall, recorded one of the videos that spread after the event turned hostile, and came away convinced that the district needed a more serious challenge to the Republican establishment.

    "whoTheyAre": "Lauren Reinhold is a Democratic candidate in Kansas' 1st Congressional District. She is a lawyer with 28 years of legal experience and a former Social Security Administration employee whose campaign grew directly out of the federal workforce upheaval tied to DOGE. Her public biography is thinner than those of the statewide candidates, but the main outlines are clear: law, federal service, and a run for Congress launched in response to layoffs and buyout pressure inside government. Reinhold's professional record includes legal work, disability-related cases, administrative law, and federal union service. Unlike many congressional candidates, she did not come up through local office or party leadership. She entered the race from the federal workforce and made that disruption the emotional core of her campaign.",
    "theirRecord": "Reinhold has no legislative record, so her public record is mainly professional. She worked as an attorney-adviser at the Social Security Administration, handling disability and administrative-law matters, and she presents that work as proof that she understands how federal decisions land in ordinary people's lives. Her campaign was triggered by the DOGE push for federal employees to leave their jobs. Reinhold has said she initially resisted the pressure, then decided to run when it became clear she could either leave government quietly or fight publicly. That has made her campaign a direct rebuke to the federal-cutback politics now championed by some Kansas Republicans.",

He filed his federal statement of candidacy on February 14, 2026. Musser is not coming out of an established Republican or Democratic organization. His candidacy is tied instead to the new United Kansas Party, a small formation trying to pitch itself as a cross-partisan alternative for voters who are tired of the two-party structure. That makes him unusual in a district where most serious congressional campaigns are shaped first by Republican primary politics.",
    "theirRecord": "Musser has no elected-office record in the source material. The record is the campaign itself: a congressional bid with a modest digital footprint, limited media attention, and a message built around service, practicality, and frustration with party insiders. His public comments argue that government should listen and deliver results rather than serve donors or national party machinery. That outsider pitch is paired with a thin campaign infrastructure. The file shows a website, an FEC candidate page, and a party listing, but little sign of the donor network, endorsements, or heavy media presence that usually mark a mature districtwide campaign in western Kansas.",

    "occupation": "Kansas Secretary of State",
    "religion": "Non-denominational",
    "education": "Fort Hays State University, Hays, Kansas -- Bachelor of Arts, 1994",
    "family": "Michele Schwab has been Scott's wife throughout his political career. She appeared alongside Scott in the 2017 Good Morning America interview about Caleb's death. Michele is not publicly known to hold a separate public office or high-profile career. She has been described in media as a supportive partner and mother during and after the Caleb tragedy",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://scottschwab.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": "Scott Schwab is the Kansas secretary of state and a Republican candidate for governor in 2026. He grew up in Great Bend, graduated from Fort Hays State University in 1994, worked in Farm Bureau insurance and medical-equipment sales, and spent years in the Kansas House before moving into statewide office. He represented House District 49 over seven terms, served as speaker pro tempore, and won the secretary of state's office in 2018 and 2022. Schwab is an established Kansas Republican, but not a fringe figure. His public image is that of an institutional conservative with a business background, a long legislative resume, and direct election-management experience. His personal story also carries a nationally known tragedy: the 2016 death of his son Caleb on the Verruckt waterslide, an event that has shaped the public way Schwab talks about faith, family, and leadership.",
    "theirRecord": "As secretary of state, Schwab has been responsible for Kansas elections, business filings, and state records. He supported voter ID and other election-integrity measures earlier in his legislative career, but he also broke with election conspiracy politics after 2020 and publicly said he had seen no evidence that the presidential election in Kansas was stolen. That made him stand out inside his own party. His record is not without controversy. Kansas courts ruled that his office violated the state's open-records law by altering a computer system in a way that made some records harder to obtain. He has also been under pressure from both sides of the election debate, drawing criticism from hard-line skeptics who wanted more fraud claims and from transparency advocates who wanted more openness. In the governor's race, Schwab has centered property taxes, state control over elections, and opposition to federal interference. He also entered 2026 while dealing publicly with a lung-cancer diagnosis, which added another personal challenge to a campaign already shaped by grief, faith, and years in the spotlight.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Vicki Schmidt is the Kansas insurance commissioner and a Republican candidate for governor. She was born and raised in Wichita, graduated from the University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, and spent decades working as a pharmacist before moving into electoral politics. Her campaign repeatedly describes her as the first pharmacist to hold statewide elected office in Kansas. Schmidt and her husband Mike have been married for more than 50 years and have two sons and four grandchildren. Her public image is built less around ideological confrontation than around health-care credentials, consumer protection, and the argument that she already knows how to run a statewide office.",
    "theirRecord": "Schmidt's record stretches across both the Legislature and statewide regulation. As a state senator, she built much of her public identity around health-policy issues such as autism coverage and access to cancer care. As insurance commissioner, she has promoted her office as a practical consumer-protection agency and has made recovered money for Kansans a centerpiece of her pitch for higher office. That administrative record is central to her gubernatorial case. Her campaign argues that she has already managed a statewide department, returned money to consumers, and lowered the cost of doing business in Kansas. In a Republican field that includes more overtly ideological rivals, Schmidt is running as the candidate of executive competence and health-policy experience.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Ty Masterson is the president of the Kansas Senate and a Republican candidate for governor. He has represented Senate District 16 since 2009, previously served on the Andover City Council, and has spent years at the center of Republican power in Topeka. That makes him very different from the outsider candidates in the race: he is not asking voters to imagine how he would govern, because he has already helped shape the state's agenda. Masterson's public biography combines legislative leadership, Wichita-area civic and business connections, and explicit Christian identity. Public sources tie him to NewSpring Church in Wichita, and his campaign biography says he and his family attend there. His campaign presents him as a conservative who wants to take the priorities he has advanced in the Senate and bring them to the governor's office.",
    "theirRecord": "Masterson's record is mostly a record of power inside the Legislature. As Senate president, he has guided Republican priorities on taxes, regulation, education, and social issues, and he has played a central role in how the chamber has confronted Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. His public record is less about one signature local issue than about institutional control of the Senate and the broader direction of state government. He has also used that leadership role to advance an openly ideological campaign for governor. His public message ties tax cuts, anti-\"woke\" rhetoric, conservative social policy, and structural reforms such as changes to judicial selection into one package. That makes him one of the clearest cases in the race where legislative record and campaign platform are tightly aligned.",

Masterson has led the Kansas Senate through fights over abortion policy, and his campaign language ties the sanctity of life to his faith: \"every life is precious -- it doesn't matter your background, your ethnicity, or your color... we're all one people, created by God.\""

    "whoTheyAre": "Jeff Colyer is a physician, plastic surgeon, former lieutenant governor, and former governor of Kansas who is running for governor again in 2026 as a Republican. He grew up in Hays, graduated from Thomas More Prep, studied economics at Georgetown, earned a master's degree at Cambridge, and received his medical degree from the University of Kansas. Colyer's public identity has long combined medicine and politics. Before becoming governor, he served in the Kansas House, then as Sam Brownback's lieutenant governor. He became governor in 2018 when Brownback resigned for a federal post, making Colyer the only Kansas governor from Hays. His biography also includes an unusually extensive humanitarian medical record. The raw material describes decades of volunteer surgical work through International Medical Corps in conflict zones and humanitarian emergencies, including Rwanda in 1994 and Ukraine in 2024. That international work remains one of the most distinctive parts of his public profile.",
    "theirRecord": "Colyer's Kansas political record is anchored in his short tenure as governor and his longer stretch as lieutenant governor. His campaign and later public speeches have pointed to budget management, tax policy, and the end of long-running school-finance litigation as central accomplishments of that period. He also carries unresolved political history from the Republican side. In 2018 he lost the GOP primary to Kris Kobach by about 345 votes after serving as governor, and in 2021 he suspended a later campaign after a prostate-cancer diagnosis. Those two events remain central to how Kansas Republicans remember him. In the 2026 race, Colyer has run as an experienced conservative with a heavy emphasis on abortion, school policy, property taxes, immigration, and alignment with Donald Trump. The raw material also notes that he served as Trump's 2024 Kansas chair, making his current campaign more directly tied to Trump politics than his earlier gubernatorial run.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Ethan Corson is a Democratic state senator from Fairway who is running for governor in 2026. He is a lifelong Kansan whose public biography runs from Garden City Community College baseball to degrees from Washington University in St. Louis and Washington University School of Law, followed by work in Washington and Kansas politics. Corson's resume combines law, party leadership, and government service. Public accounts describe him as a lawyer, a former executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party, and a former official at the U.S. Department of Commerce. He later won a seat in the Kansas Senate, giving him both state and federal policy experience before launching a statewide campaign. He has emerged as one of the most institutionally backed Democrats in the governor's race. The raw material ties him to endorsements from Gov. Laura Kelly, former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, and Rep. Sharice Davids, which has helped establish him as a leading candidate in the field.",
    "theirRecord": "Corson's record is centered on the Kansas Senate and on policy work outside elected office. Public materials connect him to Senate committee work on judiciary, transportation, taxation, utilities, and oversight, while his campaign has highlighted schools, lower taxes, cost of living, health care access, and agriculture. His candidacy has also been shaped by establishment support and by fundraising. Kansas Reflector's campaign-finance roundup cited his 2025 year-end total at $902,641.13 raised, with $526,975.81 cash on hand after $375,665.32 in spending. The same reporting described him as drawing support from thousands of contributors, with roughly 70% giving less than $100. Corson's public record also stands out because his Jewish identity is part of the public file. Coverage by the Kansas City Jewish Chronicle and other sources makes that religious background clear, even though the available sources did not identify a current synagogue membership.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Cindy Holscher is a Democratic state senator from Overland Park running for governor. She was born April 26, 1969, in Slater, Missouri, and her campaign biography places her in a working-class family headed by a union construction worker and an elementary school custodian. She says she was raised on a farm, became the first college graduate in her family, and has lived in Kansas for more than 25 years with her husband, Greg, and their three children. Before running for office, Holscher worked in communications and business operations, including jobs at R.H. Donnelley, The Add Sheet, and Sprint, where her campaign says she managed multimillion-dollar budgets and operations. She later entered politics through Johnson County, carrying a biography built around public schools, family economics, and practical statehouse work rather than celebrity or movement politics.",
    "theirRecord": "Holscher served in the Kansas House from 2017 through 2020 and has served in the Kansas Senate since 2021. She was part of the coalition that reversed key pieces of the Brownback tax experiment in 2017, pushed for Medicaid expansion, and became a frequent Democratic voice on school funding, reproductive rights, and consumer concerns. One of her clearest institutional projects was co-founding the Women's Bipartisan Caucus in the Legislature, an effort meant to create cross-party working relationships in a polarized statehouse. She has also made opposition to private-school vouchers a signature issue, arguing that the policy would drain public money from local schools while doing little for many rural counties that have no private-school option at all. Her 2026 governor's race also carries a more personal political fight. In August 2025, Holscher publicly accused aides to Gov. Laura Kelly of pressuring Democrats to stay out of the gubernatorial primary when Chris Mann was seen as the preferred candidate. Mann later ran for attorney general instead, but the episode exposed a split between Holscher and the party establishment.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Marty Tuley is a Lawrence-area Democrat running for governor in 2026. He presents himself as a fourth-generation Kansan whose family roots run through farming, football, and public education, and his campaign biography says his people are \"farmers, teachers, and working people.\" He is married to Lovena Tuley. Unlike the better-known Democrats in the race, Tuley is not coming out of the Legislature, county government, or statewide advocacy groups. His public identity is built around work as an author, personal trainer, and former gym owner. His campaign has relied heavily on his own website and social-media accounts rather than on a long trail of public office, endorsements, or institutional support. That outsider status is one of the main facts about his candidacy. The record available online shows a first-time statewide candidate trying to build a plain-spoken, culturally moderate Democratic message around health, schools, family life, and personal freedom.",
    "theirRecord": "Tuley does not bring an elected-office record into the governor's race. What voters have instead is a campaign platform centered on public schools, health and fitness, marijuana legalization, economic growth, and what he describes as common-sense government. His message is less about party structure than about broad dissatisfaction with politics as usual. His clearest break with the rest of the Democratic field is on transgender athletes in girls' sports. Tuley opposes allowing transgender girls to compete in girls' sports, a position that is unusual in a Democratic gubernatorial primary and one of the few issue positions that clearly distinguishes him from the better-funded candidates. The older public record around him is thin, but it is not spotless. Raw research on his background points to legal battles tied to Total Fitness Athletic Center in 2003, when he was associated with the gym business. That episode sits much farther back in time than this campaign, but it is one of the few documented disputes attached to his name in public sources.",

        "issue": "Public Schools",

Her campaign biography says she was raised on a farm in Bourbon County, graduated from the University of Kansas, spent more than 20 years as a general contractor, homeschooled her two youngest children, and later co-owned a small manufacturing company in Olathe with two of her sons. O'Hara is not a new face in Kansas politics. She served in the Kansas House and later on the Johnson County Commission, where she built a public identity around taxes, spending, property rights, and confrontational local politics. By the time she entered the 2026 governor's race, she was already well known to Republican activists looking for a harder-edged candidate in a crowded field.",
    "theirRecord": "O'Hara's record is rooted more in local government and movement politics than in statewide office. In Johnson County she became closely identified with fights over tax policy, public spending, and the direction of county government. Her earlier service in the Kansas House and her work as a Republican district chairwoman and precinct committeewoman gave her a long runway inside party politics before this statewide bid. During the COVID-19 years, O'Hara made opposition to masks, vaccines, school closures, and business shutdowns a central part of her public message. Her 2026 campaign carries that same approach into statewide politics, pairing anti-shutdown rhetoric with broader attacks on what she describes as government overreach, election problems, and cultural drift. The result is a candidacy aimed squarely at the party's hard-right lane.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Stacy Rogers is a Wichita business owner running in the 2026 Republican primary for governor. Public campaign materials present her as a political newcomer, a mother of three sons, and a candidate shaped by family experience rather than time in the Legislature. Two of her sons have learning challenges, and that has become part of how she talks about education, parental authority, and state policy. Rogers built her campaign around a straight-talk, outsider image. She was one of the earliest Republicans to enter the race, and she has tried to frame that early start as proof that she is less cautious and less consultant-driven than better-known candidates in the field. Her public profile is much thinner than candidates such as Ty Masterson, Jeff Colyer, or Vicki Schmidt, but her campaign has worked to make family life, small business, and frustration with politics-as-usual the center of her biography.",
    "theirRecord": "Rogers does not have a legislative voting record or a long history in statewide office, so her record is mostly the campaign itself and the themes she has emphasized in public appearances. She has focused on property taxes, medical freedom, government efficiency, and a family-centered approach to school policy. That makes her candidacy less about a governing paper trail and more about how she wants voters to read her background. Her campaign messaging is openly anti-bureaucratic. She says Kansas government should be audited department by department for waste, mishandling, and fraud, and she casts herself as someone who would run state government more like a business than a political institution. The tradeoff is that the public record is still relatively thin. Compared with the front-runners, there is less evidence of how she has handled a major public office, a legislative fight, or a statewide crisis.",

Eakins served on the Wichita Board of Education after winning a close race in 2013. Her statewide campaign leans heavily on that chapter, especially her arguments during the COVID era that schools could reopen safely. She presents herself as an outsider to the party hierarchy, but not as a newcomer to public arguments over education, public health, and local government.",

She has used that experience to argue that Kansas leaders were too slow and too rigid during the pandemic, and she has said her firm's data analysis showed schools could bring students back sooner. That reopening fight is the strongest policy thread running through her campaign. Her gubernatorial message also puts her on the populist side of the Republican primary. In debate coverage and campaign interviews, she has embraced Donald Trump, talked about a coming \"golden age,\" and argued that families should have more control over medical and educational decisions. Her record is thinner on statewide office or legislation, but her school-board years and business history give voters a clear sense of the issues she wants to own.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Philip Sarnecki is a Republican candidate for governor from Bucyrus who is trying to turn private-sector success into a statewide political brand. His public identity is built around business ownership, Christian language, and an outsider message aimed at voters who are frustrated with the existing Republican field. He is married to Heidi, and his campaign materials present him as a husband, father, and businessman rather than a career officeholder. Sarnecki's biography is rooted in ventures such as RPS Financial and 513 Films. Public materials say his companies have employed nearly 1,000 Kansans across multiple industries. He has not held statewide office, so his case for governor depends almost entirely on how persuasive voters find his business history, values language, and self-presentation.",
    "theirRecord": "Sarnecki does not bring a legislative or executive government record into this race. His public record is mainly business, campaign activity, and media appearances, including promotion of 513 Films as a faith-based enterprise and a broader argument that Kansas needs a governor from outside the political establishment. That outsider posture is paired with unusually large self-funding. His 2025 year-end filing shows a campaign with real financial heft, but much of that money came from Sarnecki himself rather than from a broad donor network. So the record here is less about what he has done in public office and more about whether voters see him as a credible businessman or as a wealthy newcomer trying to buy his way into the top tier.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Kris Kobach is Kansas attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor in 2026. He grew up in Topeka, graduated from Washburn Rural High School, and built a national reputation as a lawyer and conservative activist before returning to Kansas elective politics. His resume includes degrees from Harvard, Oxford, and Yale, a law-teaching career, federal service, and years in Kansas statewide office. He lives near Lecompton with his wife, Heather, and their five children. Kobach has been one of the best-known and most polarizing Republicans in Kansas for more than a decade. He served as secretary of state from 2011 to 2019, lost the 2018 governor's race to Laura Kelly, won the attorney general's office in 2022, and has kept the same political identity throughout: hard-line on immigration, aggressive on election law, and eager to turn legal fights into public arguments.",
    "theirRecord": "As attorney general, Kobach has used the office for high-profile conservative litigation, including lawsuits involving federal vaccine policy, immigration enforcement, and COVID-era claims against Pfizer. That work fits the broader pattern of his career, which has long favored visible legal combat over low-profile administrative work. His earlier tenure as secretary of state remains central to his public record. Kobach championed Kansas' proof-of-citizenship voter registration law, which federal courts struck down after finding scant evidence of noncitizen voting and large numbers of eligible voters blocked from the rolls. The law's collapse, and the litigation costs that came with it, remain one of the defining controversies of his career. Kobach also still carries the political baggage of the 2022 Federal Election Commission penalty tied to his 2020 U.S. Senate campaign. The FEC fined him $30,000 after concluding his campaign had received an illegal in-kind corporate contribution through below-market access to We Build the Wall's fundraising list. That episode kept alive another longstanding theme in Kobach's career: national profile, sharp elbows, and ethical fights that do not fully fade.",

      {
        "issue": "Immigration",

He has been one of the loudest conservative voices on border enforcement in Kansas for over a decade."

      {
        "issue": "Abortion",

      },

He became a police officer at 21, was struck by a drunk driver during a traffic stop in 2002, then left law enforcement, went to law school, and later worked as a prosecutor in Wyandotte County and at the Kansas Securities Commission before opening a Lawrence law firm in 2016. Mann first ran statewide in 2022 and nearly beat Kris Kobach in one of the closest Kansas races of that cycle. He returned for a rematch in 2026 with a biography that is still built around public safety, courtroom work, and the argument that the attorney general's office should focus more on basic law enforcement than on partisan headline fights. Public sources also identify his wife, Ashley, as a surgeon practicing in Olathe.",

His campaign points to his time as a police officer, his work as a prosecutor, and his service at the Kansas Securities Commission as the clearest evidence of what kind of attorney general he would be. He has also served as national chairman of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a role that ties his public life to anti-DUI advocacy and to Kansas's ignition-interlock law for offenders. His electoral record is already unusual for a Kansas Democrat. In 2022 he lost to Kobach by 17,363 votes, 50.8% to 49.1%, the closest statewide race in Kansas that year. He announced a second run on July 30, 2025, framing the race as a choice between a law-enforcement-focused attorney general and Kobach's highly ideological approach to the office.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Pat Proctor is a Leavenworth Republican, retired Army colonel, Kansas House member, and 2026 candidate for secretary of state. His public biography says he served 25 years in the U.S. Army, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, before moving into state politics. He has represented Leavenworth in the Kansas House since 2020. Outside politics, he and his wife Aree co-own Baan Thai Restaurant, which gives him a small-business identity alongside his military and legislative background. That combination of soldier, lawmaker, and business owner is central to how he presents himself statewide. Proctor is not running as an outsider to election law. He chairs the House Elections Committee and has already spent years working inside the legislative machinery that writes, revises, and tightens Kansas election rules.",
    "theirRecord": "Proctor's record is defined above all by election policy. As chair of the House Elections Committee, he has been one of the Legislature's most visible advocates for stricter election rules, including requiring proof of citizenship, ending the three-day grace period for mailed ballots after Election Day, and expanding paper-based audit measures. Those are not abstract campaign promises for him; they are the core issues of his legislative identity. That matters because the secretary of state's office is where those ideas would be administered, not just debated. Proctor is running as someone who has already helped shape the state's election-law agenda from inside the House. His campaign presents that agenda as restoring confidence in elections, while critics of that approach have argued that Kansas has already seen how proof-of-citizenship rules can block eligible voters. His public record also includes a more conventional conservative frame around business services. He argues that the secretary of state's office should help Kansas businesses form and operate efficiently, and he uses Baan Thai and his military command background to support the case that he can run a rules-driven office.",

He frames these as election security measures; critics argue they could make it harder for eligible Kansans to vote."

    "whoTheyAre": "Ken Rahjes is a Republican state representative from northwest Kansas and a 2026 candidate for secretary of state. He comes out of the farm-and-ranch world near Agra and has built his public identity around agriculture, rural business, and small-town civic life. Campaign material says he was raised on a diversified family farm and ranch, studied agricultural communications at Kansas State University, and lives near Agra with his wife, Lori. Rahjes is not new to Kansas politics. He has spent a decade in the House representing the 110th District, a sprawling rural seat where water, land use, farm economics, and local infrastructure matter more than the party's national fights. His candidacy for secretary of state extends that image of a rural Republican trying to move from legislative work into statewide administration.",
    "theirRecord": "Rahjes has served in the Kansas House since 2015 and chairs the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. He has also served on budget and water-related committees, which places him squarely in the policy terrain that matters most in western and northwestern Kansas. In the secretary of state race, Rahjes has taken a lower-key tone than some of the better-known Republicans in Kansas politics. His campaign says the office should run elections people trust, simplify business filings, and stay out of the way when Kansans are trying to build something. That is a conventional conservative message, but it is rooted in the administrative work of the office rather than a personality-driven campaign.",

She says she spent 16 years in business, built a small real-estate investment firm, founded an interior design company, volunteered with the League of Women Voters, and worked for seven years as an election worker before serving in the Legislature. Day represented House District 48 from 2020 to 2021. That is a short legislative run, but it gives her a public record beyond campaign language. Her current bid for secretary of state is framed less as an ideological crusade than as an argument that the office should run elections accurately, communicate clearly with the public, and handle business filings without unnecessary friction.",
    "theirRecord": "Day's legislative archive ties her to bills and votes on concealed carry in the Capitol, the death penalty, World War II funeral honors, and international relations. It is not a long record, but it is a real one, and it distinguishes her from candidates whose public history begins with the current campaign. In the secretary of state race, Day has made election administration and business services the center of her case. She argues that voting should be accessible and secure at the same time, and she pairs that with a promise to streamline business registration and reduce bureaucratic hurdles for Kansas employers.

    "whoTheyAre": "Sam Lane is a Democratic candidate for Kansas secretary of state who presents himself as a lifelong Kansan, a former independent, and a working-class outsider. The public biography available online is spare. He describes himself as a University of Kansas psychology graduate with work experience in construction testing, retail, shipping, and food service, and he says he entered the race because he did not want to stand by while trust in elections kept deteriorating. Lane's operation is plainly small. He is not running as a party insider, a former officeholder, or a candidate with a large donor network. His appeal is built on simplicity: protect elections, take the office seriously, and stop turning it into a political weapon.",
    "theirRecord": "Lane has no previous elected office, so his public record is essentially the campaign itself. He uses his website to explain the secretary of state's duties and to argue that the office should be a safeguard for Kansas elections and business filings rather than a stage for ideological fights. That makes him different from better-known candidates in the field, but it also leaves a thinner paper trail. There are no committee assignments, legislative votes, or statewide controversies to review. Voters are being asked to judge him mostly on message, biography, and a very small early filing.",

Public biographies say he graduated from Hutchinson Community College and Emporia State University, served in the Kansas Army National Guard, married his wife Diane in 1985, and has spent roughly three decades in the insurance business. Hawkins is not running as an outsider. He is one of the central Republican power brokers in Topeka, and his campaign for insurance commissioner leans heavily on that fact. The pitch is that he knows business, regulation, and the Legislature well enough to step into one of the state's most technical statewide offices without a long learning curve.",
    "theirRecord": "His record in this race is tied directly to his legislative leadership. As speaker, Hawkins has been part of the Republican governing core on taxes, abortion, and Medicaid expansion, and his insurance commissioner candidacy turns that broader conservative record into a case for regulatory authority. In public campaign language, he frames government expansion as a threat to liberty and presents himself as a defender of business growth and traditional family politics. The most politically important issue in the source file is his handling of Senate Bill 360, the pharmacy benefit manager bill. Kansas Reflector reported that Hawkins repeatedly maneuvered to keep the measure from advancing, even as it had broad bipartisan support and would have tightened state oversight of middlemen in the prescription-drug market. The bill ultimately moved forward anyway, leaving Hawkins open to criticism that he used the speaker's office to block a consumer-protection measure while seeking a job as the state's top insurance regulator.",

She first won her Senate seat in 2016, then switched parties in late 2018 after breaking with Kansas Republicans. That party switch remains one of the most visible turning points in her public career. Sykes has built her public profile in Johnson County and in the Statehouse as a legislative leader rather than as an insurance-industry figure. In this race, she is presenting herself as a consumer-focused candidate who wants the insurance department to concentrate on household costs, coverage problems, and oversight of insurers. Her campaign has also benefited from support from two former Kansas insurance commissioners, Kathleen Sebelius and Sandy Praeger. That gives her a notable coalition in a race where most candidates are trying to prove they understand both regulation and retail politics.",
    "theirRecord": "Sykes's record is rooted in legislative leadership. As Senate minority leader, she has been one of the most visible Democrats in the Kansas Legislature, and her public record includes advocacy on health care costs, Medicaid expansion, school funding, and protections for vulnerable Kansans. Her insurance campaign extends that same affordability argument into a regulatory office. In the insurance race, Sykes has made the clearest public case that Kansas households are paying too much for coverage and that the office should be more willing to challenge insurers. She has said the cost of health insurance in Kansas is out of control, and she has framed the job as one that should protect policyholders rather than the industry it regulates. She has also tried to draw a sharper ethical distinction in the field by pledging to reject insurance-industry money. That stance, together with endorsements from Praeger and Sebelius, has helped define her as the candidate arguing for a more independent regulator.",

    "incumbent": true,
    "occupation": "Business owner",
    "hometown": "Hays, KS (P.O. Box 522, Hays, KS 67601)",
    "religion": "Roman Catholic -- active member, St. Joseph Catholic Church, Hays",
    "education": "Education is \"fully funded\" in her view",
    "family": "Tom Wasinger; Spouse: Tom",
    "district": "Kansas House District 111",
    "campaignWebsite": "https://barbforkansas.com/",
    "whoTheyAre": "Barbara K. Wasinger is the Republican state representative for Kansas House District 111, a Hays-based seat she has held since 2019. Her political career began locally and moved up step by step: Hays city commissioner in 2005, mayor in 2008 and again in 2010, Ellis County commissioner in 2012, then the Kansas House. Public biographical material describes her as a small-business owner in the title and abstract business, a St. Catherine University graduate with concentrations in journalism and theology, and a longtime Hays resident married to Tom Wasinger with four adult children. Wasinger is one of those western Kansas politicians whose identity is inseparable from the local civic world. She has spent more than two decades in elected office, writes regular legislative updates, and keeps up a steady public presence at coffees, town halls, and local media appearances. Her political style is less firebrand than operator: a lawmaker who knows the committees, the local governments, and the bureaucracies she is trying to move.",
    "theirRecord": "Her biggest recent legislative achievement is House Bill 2433, the 2026 measure that cleared the way for water to move through county rights-of-way without local permitting barriers. The bill was aimed directly at the long-running R9 Ranch dispute that has shaped Hays' search for a durable water supply, and Wasinger was the primary sponsor and chief public advocate. In a district where water security is a practical issue, not an abstraction, that was a signature win. Wasinger also carried Senate Bill 334 on nursing faculty requirements, arguing that Kansas needed a wider pool of instructors as hospitals and community colleges struggled with workforce shortages. She played a central role in the state's 2024 cybersecurity push after the judicial branch hack, and in 2026 she used a parliamentary motion to cut off debate and force an immediate House vote to override Gov. Laura Kelly's veto of Senate Bill 244, the biological-sex bill affecting state documents and access to sex-separated spaces. That move made her a focal point in one of the Legislature's most divisive fights.",
    "whatTheyStandFor": [
      {
        "issue": "Abortion",
        "stance": "Strongly pro-life. She has stated that \"human life begins at conception and deserves legal protection at every stage until natural death.\" She voted yes on the Value Them Both Amendment and supports the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Her only stated exception is the life of the mother."
      },
      {
        "issue": "Guns / Second Amendment",

        "issue": "Transgender / Biological Sex",
        "stance": "Voted to override Gov. Kelly's veto on Senate Bill 244, the biological-sex bill that requires birth-sex markers on state documents and restricts access to sex-separated facilities. She made the procedural motion to cut off debate and force the vote, making her a central figure in that fight. Notably, on an iVoterGuide survey she reportedly indicated support for adding sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes in non-discrimination laws, which is an unusual position for a conservative Republican and may warrant further verification."
      },
      {
        "issue": "Property Taxes",
        "stance": "This is her stated top priority. She has said Kansas needs \"a more equitable way to impose property taxes\" and wants to keep older residents from being taxed out of their homes."
      },
      {
        "issue": "Water",
        "stance": "She authored and passed House Bill 2433, the 2026 water-transfer law that cleared the way for the R9 Ranch pipeline to bring water to Hays. She favors private ownership of water rights over government control."
      },
      {
        "issue": "Food Sales Tax",

    "whoTheyAre": "Mason Ruder is the mayor of Hays and a member of the Hays City Commission. He is a Fort Hays State University graduate, a Certified Public Manager, and one of the more institutionally connected young officials in Ellis County public life. Public records also tie him to work with Northwest Kansas Economic Innovation Center and to Hays Catholic Schools, where he has served in advancement leadership. Ruder's public identity is intensely local. He came up through Hays schools and Hays civic networks, and his name is attached to the city's Catholic institutions, city government, and business-development efforts. He was also identified in public coverage as the youngest city commissioner in Hays history. That mix of city hall, Catholic-school leadership, and local economic development explains why his profile is broader than a typical small-city commissioner. He is not just an officeholder; he is part of the web of institutions that shape public life in Hays.",
    "theirRecord": "Ruder has served on the Hays City Commission since 2019 and was elected mayor by fellow commissioners during the January 2026 reorganization. His tenure has overlapped with the city's biggest ongoing policy fights, especially long-term water supply, housing growth, and downtown development. One of the clearest public markers of his record is the R9 Ranch water project. He testified before the Kansas House Local Government Committee in January 2026 defending the Hays water transfer plan, and city coverage has shown him repeatedly framing R9 as a generational infrastructure project rather than a routine public-works item. He has also backed downtown and quality-of-life projects, including a permanent stage proposal in Municipal Park and other development efforts tied to housing and retail growth. Ruder has also tried to build a more visible civic role for younger residents. He helped create a youth advisory board for Hays High and TMP-Marian students so they could speak directly to city leaders. During the COVID period, he was also publicly identified with a split on city pandemic policy: the raw record ties him to the lone dissenting vote against a local mask mandate.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Alaina Cunningham is a Hays city commissioner and, since January 2026, the city's vice mayor. Public profiles describe her as a registered nurse and ACE-certified group fitness instructor at HaysMed's Center for Health Improvement. She moved to Hays from Dodge City in 2010 and built her local profile through healthcare work, parent involvement, and civic boards before stepping into city government. She first joined the commission by appointment after Michael Berges left for the Ellis County Commission, then won a full term in 2023. Public records also place her on the HaysMed Foundation board and the Downtown Hays Development Corporation board. That background has made her one of the commission's more community-facing members rather than one of its louder political personalities.",
    "theirRecord": "Cunningham's record on the commission has been tied to the unglamorous issues that dominate city government in western Kansas: water, housing supply, growth, and budget tradeoffs. In candidate forums and local coverage, she has treated water as a long-term survival issue for Hays and linked housing and quality of life to whether the city can keep families and retirees in town. Her rise to vice mayor in the 2026 commission reorganization marked a step up in visibility, but her public record still reads more administrative than ideological. The source material shows a commissioner who talks about service delivery, sustainable growth, and local livability, not a figure known for public feuds or a long list of polarizing votes.",

He works as an account representative for Nex-Tech, has lived in Hays for about 30 years, and spent seven years as co-owner of the Paisley Pear Wine Bar, Bistro and Market with his wife, Heather, before the business was sold in 2024. Musil has been on the commission since 2013, which makes him one of the city's most experienced elected officials. His public style is understated. He is not a partisan brand-builder. He reads instead as a city hall veteran whose name is tied to the daily grind of water policy, development debates, and pandemic decisions.",
    "theirRecord": "Musil's record is dominated by the R9 Ranch water project, the long-running effort to secure Hays' future water supply. In candidate Q&A coverage, he has repeatedly described water as the city's main unfinished business and has treated the pipeline as a generational project rather than a routine utility upgrade. He also had a prominent role during the COVID period. Musil voted to extend Hays' mask ordinance while serving as mayor, and local coverage later reported that his family faced vandalism and threats after the decision. That episode remains one of the sharpest tests of political pressure in recent Hays city government. Musil has also backed housing and retail-development efforts and has argued that city growth depends on expanding the tax base while keeping long-term utility planning on track. His ownership of the Paisley Pear gave him a visible downtown stake during some of those debates, though public sources here showed no formal ethics complaint.",

Her public identity is rooted in local finance and civic stewardship rather than ideology. City and local-news profiles tie her to a long career at Sunflower Bank, followed by five years as executive director of the Heartland Community Foundation before she retired from that role at the end of 2020. Jacobs is one of the most experienced members of the Hays commission. She has described herself as a Hays native and has spent years in city leadership, including multiple turns as mayor. The public record shows a commissioner whose emphasis stays on infrastructure, water, development, and budgets rather than personal branding.",
    "theirRecord": "Jacobs has been one of the commission's most consistent public advocates for the R9 Ranch water project, the long-running effort to secure Hays' future water supply through a major pipeline project. In local coverage, she has treated water as the city's top long-term responsibility and has defended the project as necessary even as costs rose and litigation dragged on. She has also taken visible positions on development and budget questions. Jacobs has argued for retail growth, defended sustainable budgeting, and supported city investment when she believed it would strengthen Hays over the long term. During the pandemic-era mask debate, she voted with the majority to extend the ordinance. In January 2026, she stepped aside from the mayor's role when the commission reorganized and chose Mason Ruder as mayor.",

Public records credit him with 19 years in the Hays Police Department and additional military police service, giving him more than two decades in law enforcement and public safety before he entered city politics. His business work after policing has centered on de-escalation, tactical communication, and self-defense training. Vilaysing's public image is practical and service-oriented. He is not a career politician and did not rise through a party ladder. He came to the commission from the worlds of policing, instruction, and community safety, which helps explain why his public comments often focus on operations, procedures, and whether the city is handling everyday problems effectively.",
    "theirRecord": "Vilaysing was elected to the Hays City Commission in 2025, so his formal governing record is still new. In candidate statements and early meeting coverage, he emphasized water, housing, transparency, and basic city competence. Once in office, he asked pointed operational questions about the cost and purpose of city programs, including pet licensing, and pressed staff and fellow commissioners on how decisions were being made. That detail-first style matches his law-enforcement background. The source material does not show a long list of headline-making votes or a major ideological crusade. It shows a new commissioner trying to work from the mechanics of city government outward.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Toby Dougherty is the city manager of Hays, an appointed administrator who has been the city's top staff official since 2007. He previously served as assistant city manager after arriving in Hays in 2005, which means he has been the constant figure in city government while mayors and commissioners changed around him. His public identity is administrative, not electoral, but his influence over long-range planning, budgeting, and infrastructure is substantial. Dougherty grew up in Lucas, Kansas, graduated from the University of Kansas in political science, and spent time in the transportation industry before moving into municipal government. Before Hays, he served as city administrator in Gallatin, Missouri. In local coverage, he is the staff official most closely associated with Hays' long-term water strategy, capital planning, and the practical mechanics of city government.",
    "theirRecord": "Dougherty's record is defined above all by water policy. He has been one of the main public defenders of the R9 Ranch Water Pipeline, the city's long-running attempt to secure a larger and more dependable water supply. That work has put him at the center of litigation, state-level hearings, conservation rules, and repeated public explanations about why Hays sees water as a generational problem rather than a short-term inconvenience. He has also become the public face of Hays' conservation strategy. In interviews over several years, he has pointed to western cities such as Las Vegas, Tucson, and Phoenix as examples of how dry communities survive by treating water use as a long-term management problem. More recently, he has been the official explaining the Build Kansas grant for water planning, budget caution, maintenance schedules, and infrastructure projects ranging from meters to airport upgrades.",

The current official record also identifies him as president of the Kansas Sheriffs' Association. Braun's public identity in Ellis County rests on two pillars: law enforcement and Catholic parish life. He is tied to St. Nicholas of Myra Catholic Church in Hays through church council leadership and the Knights of Columbus, which gives him a visible place inside one of the county's most durable civic networks.",
    "theirRecord": "Braun has made jail capacity one of the defining issues of his term. In public meetings and local coverage, he has argued that the county's need for a larger facility is not speculative and not political. He has tied the issue to mental-health placement problems, inmate transport burdens, and the practical cost of housing prisoners elsewhere. He has also taken a public role in explaining Ellis County's cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. After signing an ICE memorandum in 2025, Braun said the county could honor detainers only within the legal 48-hour window and made clear that local deputies are not roaming the county doing federal immigration work.

    "whoTheyAre": "Aaron J. Cunningham is the Ellis County attorney, a Hays native who followed a straight local path into public office. He graduated from Hays High School in 2012, earned his undergraduate degree at Kansas State University, and received his law degree from Washburn University School of Law in 2019. Public biographies say a Dane G. Hansen Foundation scholarship helped shape his decision to return to western Kansas after law school. Cunningham interned for former Ellis County Attorney Tom Drees, then joined the office after passing the bar. He handled drug and DUI work as an assistant county attorney, stayed on under Drees' successor Robert Anderson, and ran unopposed for the top job in 2024 after Anderson left to return to private practice. In public, he presents himself as a homegrown prosecutor who came back to Hays to build a career in the same county where he grew up.",
    "theirRecord": "Cunningham's clearest early break with the recent past was his decision to resume prosecuting marijuana possession cases after the office had paused many of them. In a February 17, 2025, profile, he said the county attorney does not get to decide on his own what should be legal and what should not. He took the same line with hemp-derived Delta-8 and Delta-10 products, warning that the office would enforce Kansas law as written even if neighboring states were moving in a different direction. The office he runs is broader than a single drug-policy debate. Ellis County assigns the attorney's office to prosecute misdemeanors and felonies, handle juvenile and child-in-need-of-care cases, and work through alcohol, drug, and mental-illness proceedings. Cunningham has also spoken about a practical problem familiar in rural Kansas: too few lawyers, too many defendants waiting in jail, and a need to prioritize cases without letting victims lose contact with the system.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Bobbi L. Dreiling is the Ellis County clerk and election officer, the official who runs county elections and manages a large share of the county's daily paperwork. Public records say she earned an associate degree from Hutchinson Community College, spent eight years as deputy clerk under Donna Maskus, then won the clerk's office in 2020. She was re-elected in 2024 by a wide margin, beating Democrat Laura Allen 9,971 votes to 2,975. County clerk is one of those offices voters mostly notice only when something goes wrong. In Ellis County, that means Dreiling's biography is tightly bound to administration rather than ideology: election calendars, tax rolls, commission minutes, and the mechanics of getting ballots printed, counted, and secured. Her public profile is stronger on that work than on personal biography.",
    "theirRecord": "Dreiling's most visible public controversy was the fight over closing the polling place at Fort Hays State University. She defended the move by pointing to low turnout and ADA concerns, and the dispute turned into a larger argument over campus voting access, cost, and whether the county was discouraging student participation. The issue drew intervention from voting-rights advocates and made a county clerk's administrative decision part of a wider public debate. Her office has also pushed a series of practical election changes, including security cameras at the ballot drop box and ballot-counting rooms, Saturday early voting, and voter-notification efforts. The source material also points back to a 2020 episode, before she became elected clerk, when 3,800 misprinted ballots were sent out while she was deputy clerk. Even in that record, the through line is administrative: a clerk's office under pressure to get details right in public.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Nathan Leiker is the Ellis County Commissioner for District 3 and the commission's vice chair in 2026. He is vice president of L5 Farms, a Hays-based crop operation with work in Ellis and Rush counties, and his public biography is rooted in western Kansas agriculture rather than in law, lobbying, or party politics. Leiker grew up in the Hays area, graduated from Thomas More Prep-Marian in 2004, and entered county government through a competitive Republican primary in 2022 rather than through appointment or inheritance. He won that four-way primary with 764 votes, defeating both challenger Chris McGowne and incumbent Joe LeRoux. His public identity is that of a farm operator asked to make county-government decisions. The language around him is practical: land use, water, budgets, tax pressure, and whether county spending pays off over time.",
    "theirRecord": "Leiker's record on the county commission combines fiscal conservatism with a willingness to fund specific priorities. During the 2026 budget process, he supported the county's 1.96 mill levy increase after what he described as nearly 13 hours of department-by-department review. In that same discussion, he argued that increased mental-health spending was \"less expensive than building a new jail,\" which put him on the side of preventive spending rather than simply cutting costs. He has also taken concrete positions on growth and development. He supported Big Creek Estates housing approvals and has spoken openly about the need for the county to work with the city of Hays on water and higher-paying jobs. That places him in the lane of commissioners who want development, but with close attention to infrastructure and tax consequences. Outside county government, Leiker's record is tied to agricultural and rural institutions. Public sources connect him to L5 Farms, the Kansas Hereford Association, and county and regional boards, reinforcing that his political base is the farm economy and the surrounding Ellis County civic network.",

    "whoTheyAre": "Neal Younger is the Ellis County Commissioner for District 2 and the commission chairman in 2026. He came into office from the trades, not from a political résumé, and public sources consistently describe him as an electrician and plumber with a blue-collar background. Younger first won the seat in 2020, defeating incumbent Dustin Roths and Kerry McCue in a three-way Republican primary with 639 votes, or 40.16 percent. He then ran unopposed in the general election. His public style has stayed close to that origin story: low-profile, direct, and focused on county budgets, roads, water, and departmental operations rather than personality or branding. He has almost no social-media presence and very little public biographical material beyond office-related coverage. What the public record does show is a commissioner who talks in practical terms about staffing, infrastructure, communication, and whether county spending is actually worth it.",
    "theirRecord": "Younger's clearest governing trait is fiscal skepticism paired with case-by-case pragmatism. He ran in 2020 on the argument that Ellis County was spending too much money, but in 2026 he supported a budget increase after deciding that added mental-health funding was \"less expensive than building a new jail.\" That is one of the most concrete statements of his governing philosophy in the record. He has also taken visible positions on development and infrastructure. Public coverage shows him calling for closer county-city cooperation, especially around water and economic development, and saying the county should work with the city of Hays to bring in more water and higher-paying jobs. In housing discussions, he pressed for practical answers on rural water access during the Big Creek Estates conversation. Younger has also talked about government in a hands-on way. In campaign coverage, he said he wanted to spend time in every county department to understand staffing and needs directly rather than govern from a distance. That fits with the broader picture of a commissioner who approaches county government like a working manager rather than a public personality.",

There is very little else in the public record to attach to her personally. That does not make the office unimportant; it means the role is administrative rather than personality-driven.

That decision gave voters a clear example of how he approaches county administration: user-fee based, budget-minded, and focused on office operations. He has also pointed to budget reductions and customer-flow improvements as evidence that the treasury office became more efficient under his watch. In local coverage, he said the fee generated more than $50,000 a year and helped reduce the office budget substantially.

Public records describe him as a retired agriculture teacher who spent 31 years in the district, won Kansas Teacher of the Year while still relatively young, and later moved into ranching, farming, and small business work around Antonino and Hays. He and his wife Ruth raised five children. Vajnar brings more than a teacher's biography to the board. He is one of those local figures who stayed visible after retirement and then translated a long school career into school governance. In Hays, that gives him credibility with people who know the district from inside and with taxpayers who see him as a rural, fiscally cautious voice.",
    "theirRecord": "Vajnar has made transparency and contract review recurring themes of his board service. He has argued that meetings and work sessions should be held at times the public can actually attend, that proceedings should be recorded, and that board members need enough time to read major contracts before voting. In 2025 he voted against the Hays High and Roosevelt construction contract, saying he did not believe board members had enough opportunity to educate themselves on it. He has also been central in several of the district's internal fights. He opposed hiring Superintendent Ron Wilson's wife through the consent agenda, pressed for a closer look at nepotism rules, and pulled the proposed Golden Belt Bank naming-rights agreement from the agenda because he believed the district should seek better value and let other businesses compete. Even as board president, he has not been a reflexive vote for the administration.",

Her public profile is local, finance-oriented, and closely tied to Hays civic life. She is also part of one of the most visible political families in the area.

That approach shows up most clearly in how she talks about fiscal responsibility, district employees, and board trust.

He and his wife Emily moved back to Hays in 2015 and have three children in district schools. That medical background makes Yarmer unusual on a local school board.

In public commentary on the district's bond and capital outlay spending, he criticized what he called weak oversight and pointed to specific line items, including a concession stand, a digital scoreboard, tennis courts, and a marquee sign, while arguing that other needs were waiting. He has also pushed to see multiple project prices together before approving individual phases of the bond work. His record includes a broader argument about governance. Yarmer has asked for bids and board review before major purchases, pressed for more time to study agendas, and argued during emergency policy discussions that parents do not surrender their rights during the school day.

His wife Patti also worked in education, and all four of their children went through USD 489 from prekindergarten to Hays High.

In the district's repeated arguments over bond oversight, he has aligned often with Derek Yarmer as part of the faction asking harder questions about timing, pricing, and administrative detail. He was one of two dissenting votes when the board approved hiring Superintendent Ron Wilson's wife as a teacher, and he has pushed for more direct review of administrator contracts instead of broad approval through the consent agenda.

    "whoTheyAre": "Jayme Goetz is a lifelong Hays resident, a Fort Hays State University mathematics instructor, and a member of the USD 489 school board. Public candidate profiles say she attended local schools, earned three degrees from Fort Hays State, taught for a year in Ellsworth, then spent seven years at Hays High before joining the FHSU math faculty. Her public identity is closely tied to the district she helps oversee. Goetz has children in USD 489, and her comments in board and campaign settings often come from the perspective of a teacher and parent rather than from the perspective of a district administrator. That local, teacher-first profile is what defines her in public life. She is not a statewide figure or a culture-war personality. She is a local board member whose public record is built from candidate questionnaires, board meetings, and school policy debates in Hays.",
    "theirRecord": "Goetz has developed a record as a board member who asks for clearer explanations of district decisions. The raw material links her to questions about how salary figures were calculated, whether discipline rules in the student handbook were specific enough, and how spending choices would be understood by families. She has also been willing to take positions in local disputes rather than simply stay quiet. In the mascot debate at Hays Middle School, she supported the 5-2 vote to change the school mascot to Indians after reviewing survey responses that she said reflected ignorance and immaturity. In other board matters, she backed laptops for Hays High students after hearing from teachers who preferred them. Her voting pattern in the raw material generally places her with the board majority, but not as a passive member. The record points instead to a member who supports district operations while pressing for clearer communication, more predictable rules, and more understandable justifications.",

He has been the superintendent during the construction of the new Hays High School, the Roosevelt Elementary addition, and the broader debate over how aggressively the district should keep investing in its buildings and athletic facilities. The most notable controversy in his public record came during the 2022 bond election, when an email he sent to district staff about turnout incentives drew scrutiny and public criticism.
