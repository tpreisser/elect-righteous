  summary: |
    All 56 candidate-like slugs now render as v2 candidate pages; inventory
    reports zero missing UI candidate entries and zero candidates not rendered
    as v2 pages. Added Cathy Hopkins to close the State Board of Education
    District 5 missing-candidate gap.

    Rehydrated issue-mapped social/online observations across the v2 profiles
    from existing memory research. Social follows, likes, comments, public
    posts, platform absences, and online-public-record observations remain in
    the product, but render as issue-scoped observations rather than inferred
    beliefs.

    UI corrections landed:
    - top metric boxes removed from candidate profiles
    - "Where They Stand on Big Issues" restored as the major issue section
    - source trails moved to /candidates/[slug]/sources/
    - "What You Should Know," "What They Stand For," "Issue Areas," and
      "Record Items" absent from built candidate output
    - social evidence rows flattened so they no longer render as oversized
      solid boxes
    - candidate grid cards standardized
    - floating bottom-left Preisser Solutions badge restored
    - footer CTA uses the supplied Preisser Solutions snippet

    Local browser QA on the static export confirmed Roger Marshall renders
    the new issue heading, separate Source Trail link, and Preisser Solutions
    badge. Mobile viewport check showed no body-level horizontal overflow.

  summary: |
    Operator clarified that all candidates must be redone, not only candidates
    with screenshots, comments, or visible social-comment behavior. Throughput
    plan and inventory script updated accordingly: all 55 candidate-like slugs
    remain in v2 conversion scope. Lanes now control sequencing and research
    depth, not whether a candidate is rebuilt. Comment/screenshot/social
    handling applies universally: visible comments, platform absence, silence,
    screenshot captures, and candidate-controlled platform footprint are
    evidence categories for every candidate.

    Current inventory from node scripts/phase2-inventory.mjs:
    - total candidate-like slugs: 55
    - active 2026 candidate slugs: 35
    - missing UI candidate entries: michael-berges

    Compiled v2 issue YAML into typed candidate profiles for Ken Brooks,
    Nathan Leiker, and Ruth Ruder, added a v2 registry, and added a shared
    /candidates-v2/[slug] preview route that renders Allen Park plus the three
    newly compiled profiles.

    Browser verification confirmed all four v2 preview pages render h1 text,
    issue cards, and source panels:
    - /candidates-v2/allen-park/ — 1 issue card
    - /candidates-v2/ken-brooks/ — 3 issue cards
    - /candidates-v2/nathan-leiker/ — 4 issue cards
    - /candidates-v2/ruth-ruder/ — 6 issue cards

    Operator correction remains binding for next passes: every candidate and
    current-officeholder profile gets rebuilt into v2. Comments/screenshots/
    social-platform footprint are universal evidence categories, not a filter
    that narrows the candidate set.

  summary: |
    Wrote Mason Ruder and Tracey Mann v2 issue YAML, compiled both into typed
    CandidateFullV2 files, and registered both in the shared /candidates-v2
    route. Wave 1 now has six rendered v2 preview pages: Allen Park, Ken
    Brooks, Nathan Leiker, Ruth Ruder, Mason Ruder, and Tracey Mann.

    Operator corrected the social-content interpretation: social research
    (who candidates follow, like, comment on, post, and where platform absences
    matter) must remain part of the product, but as a proportionate relevance
    section rather than the whole candidate filter. UI updated accordingly:
    "In Their Own Words" is a collapsible dropdown for relevant social
    activity; concrete social signals still map to issue cards.

    Public page labels corrected:
    - "What They Stand For" -> "Where They Stand on Big Issues"
    - "Their Record Summary" -> "Their Record"
    - "Follow the Money" -> "Donor/Funding Information"
    - "What You Should Know" standalone section removed
    - "Where They Worship" remains a dropdown

    v2 layout changed from a narrow issue-only page to collapsible dossier
    sections: Who They Are, Their Record, Where They Stand on Big Issues, In
    Their Own Words, Where They Worship, Donor/Funding Information, and
    Sources. Fixed Preisser Solutions badge now stays compact so it no longer covers
    candidate content by default.

  summary: |
    Flattened the "In Their Own Words" social activity dropdown on the current
    candidate page. Removed oversized quote tiles and replaced them with compact
    rows: small context label, normal 16px body quote, source chip. The social
    scrub remains available, but it no longer visually dominates the page.

    Browser checks confirmed visible labels:
    - "What You Should Know" absent
    - "What They Stand For" absent
    - "Where They Stand on Big Issues" present
    - "In Their Own Words" present
    - "Donor/Funding Information" present

    Election accuracy is not fully closed. Fixed presentation clarity on
    /elections by separating "2026 Local Ballot" from "Current Local Officials
    — Not on the 2026 Ballot." Remaining known P0: michael-berges appears in
    ellis-county-2026-ballot but has no candidate entry/profile yet. Hays City
    and USD 489 are still current/off-cycle reference pages with 2027 dates, not
    active 2026 races.

  could_not_confirm: 5 items (1: USD 489 BoardDocs portal HTTP 403 + JS-rendered to fetches; individual motion PDFs not directly retrievable; 2: individual yes-vote roll-call attribution for AE-4/AE-5/AE-11 — contemporaneous coverage names no-voters/abstainers/absent only; Ruder's yes is inferable from roster minus those, BoardDocs minutes would confirm; 3: AE-1 BoardDocs agenda-item number for handbook approval not surfaced in article; 4: April 20 vs April 21 2026 bathroom-vandalism meeting-date ambiguity — Hays Post says "Monday night," posted Tue Apr 22; 5: Ellis County Clerk Appointment-of-Treasurer for Ruder's 2023 race not retrieved — but per Kansas PDC rules school-board races are NOT under state oversight, only the Wichita board is, so substantive disclosure system does not exist for this office). All blockers environmental, not factual. None halt-condition.
  refinements_to_sleuth: 5 (1: AE-9 naming-rights CORRECTED — there was NO yes vote by Ruder on accepting the deal. Sleuth said "Ruth Ruder voted with Ken Brooks and Meagan Zampieri-Lillpopp in favor." Primary record: 3-3 procedural vote at Aug 4 2025 retreat to add the item to upcoming Monday agenda; failed for lack of a 4th yes. Vajnar then pulled the item from Sept 8 meeting agenda. Offer expired Sept 15 without an accept vote. Ruder's "It belongs to the town" + "sell your soul" remarks are best read as retreat-floor commentary, not yes-vote-with-reservations. Symmetry-significant correction. 2: AE-3 bond-project-manager CORRECTED — vote was 3-4 FAILED (Yarmer/Park/Vajnar YES; Ruder + Goetz + two others NO), not 5-2 as some earlier text suggested. Hays Post primary anchor: hayspost.com/posts/e4ec7011. 3: Title arc more nuanced than sleuth's "Vice President (incumbent)" framing. July 15 2024 reorganization: Vajnar President, Goetz VP. Sept 2024-Dec 2025: Ruder = Board Member. Feb 24 2026 article: Ruder = Board Vice President (post-Jan 2026 reorg). Apr 21 2026 article: Ruder = Board Member again. Current Highbond portal: Vajnar President, BROOKS VP, Ruder Member. Narrative-writer must avoid asserting "Vice President" as current title without live verification. 4: AE-1 discipline-policy meeting PINNED to 2025-07-21 (Hays High handbook 6-1, Park no). Sleuth said "meeting date not specified." Article in fact does specify via the handbook-approval vote referenced. 5: AE-5 December 15 2025 meeting carries MULTIPLE concurrent agenda items — Felten land 5-1, flooring/asbestos 4-2, Integrated Solutions $110,315 asbestos contract — not just the land-sale framing sleuth captured.

Do you know how much revenue that one tournament brings to our city?"; AE-13 Feb 24 2026 HVAC 3-2 fail + admin-contract 4-2 with Ruder voting AGAINST blanket extension, reversing AE-4 posture; AE-14 pre-board-service Oct 2023 candidate forum and Oct/Jul 2023 candidate Q&A — full stated-position cluster including bathroom-design framing "review board policies"/"ask advice from the board attorney" usable as IssueCard.stated anchor)

    Deep-scrape v2 raw-dump written for ruth-ruder. 14 primary-tier-anchored
    ActionEvidence buildable for Stage 2.d — well above ≥3 directive floor and
    above ≥6 stretch goal.

    Strongest single corrections:
    1. AE-9 naming-rights: NO YES VOTE by Ruder on accepting Golden Belt Bank
       $200K offer. Sleuth-pass implied a yes vote with reservations. Primary
       record: 3-3 procedural vote Aug 4 2025 retreat (Ruder/Brooks/Zampieri-
       Lillpopp yes; Yarmer absent; vote failed for lack of 4th yes). Vajnar
       pulled item from Sept 8 agenda. Offer expired Sept 15 without an accept
       vote. Ruder's "It belongs to the town" + "sell your soul" quotes are
       retreat-floor commentary, not yes-vote-with-reservations. Symmetry-
       significant for narrative-writer framing.
    2. AE-3 bond-project-manager vote was 3-4 FAILED (Vajnar in YES minority
       with Park + Yarmer; Ruder in NO majority), not 5-2 as some earlier text
       suggested. Primary anchor: hayspost.com/posts/e4ec7011-734d-4c18-ab28-
       c5b38d236126.
    3. Title arc: Ruder = Board Member (Jan 2024-Dec 2025) → Board Vice
       President (Feb 2026 per Feb 24 article) → Board Member again (Apr 21
       2026 article). Current Highbond portal: Vajnar President, BROOKS VP.
       Narrative-writer must not assert "VP" as current title without live-
       portal verification.

    Strongest new findings:
    1. AE-13 Feb 24 2026: Ruder voted AGAINST both (a) delaying admin-contract
       decision to March 9 (3-3 failed), AND (b) the 4-2 motion to extend
       admin contracts to March 9. Compared to AE-4 (Jan 22 2024) where Ruder
       voted YES on the blanket extension. Two-year posture shift on the
       admin-contract process question, anchored to two dated motions.
    2. AE-12 Feb 19 2025 athletic-facility sequence: Ruder consistently YES
       across digital marquee 6-1, weight room 7-0, scoreboards 5-2, tennis
       6-1, wrestling mats 5-2. Frames athletic infrastructure as community-
       revenue source. Counter-balances AE-9 "sell your soul" framing — Ruder
       has both pro-commercial-revenue and anti-commercial-revenue quotes on
       record; primary read is "public-asset-as-community-revenue-source"
       posture rather than ideological "anti-commercial."
    3. AE-10 Sept 9 2024 O'Loughlin MGP tabling vote 5-2 + Ruder verbatim
       proposes selling Lincoln Elementary / Rockwell Administration Center
       to fund bond projects. Pro-fiscal-prudence framing, votes WITH Park
       against Brooks on a $14.49M MGP. Cross-cuts the "administration-aligned
       bloc" narrative sleuth captured for R-3 — Ruder is not monolithically
       admin-aligned.

    13 dated USD 489 board meetings anchored: 2024-01-22, 2024-07-15 (reorg),
    2024-09-09, 2024-12-19 (special), 2025-02-19, 2025-03-24, 2025-07-21,

    2026-03-10, 2026-04-07, 2026-04-20-or-21.

    Halt: none. Sensitivity: not required. Family-network adjacency: no
    observable amplification of Vernon/Mason Ruder positions by Ruth in the

Wikipedia/Vote-Smart aggregation lists 4 caucuses Mann's own snippet doesn't lead with. This is the most substantively-corrected finding of this v2 pass. Narrative-writer must surface bipartisan caucus footprint in Agriculture IssueCard at minimum. 2: Medicaid Gap evidence HARDENED to primary tier. Sleuth-pass cited KSNT "strengthen Medicaid" + May 22 vote. v2 dump adds: (a) KWCH 2025-05-15 "It's a false narrative to say we're going to cut Medicaid" — sharper stated-position quote; (b) Mann's own June 9, 2025 OBBBA press release (LegiStorm mirror) framing Medicaid/SNAP as "exploited and expanded beyond their initial intent" — Mann's own post-vote characterization. Gap candidate now has 3 evidence anchors instead of 2, all primary or near-primary tier, all symmetry-test-passable.)

  summary: |
    Deep-scrape v2 raw-dump written. 10 primary-tier ActionEvidence buildable for
    Stage 2.d — well above 6+ federal-tier target.

    Strongest single finding: Caucus list CORRECTED. Sleuth-pass framed Mann's
    caucus footprint as a 4-caucus conservative-coalition stack (RSC, Western,
    Pro-Life, Values Action Team). v2 dump surfaces formal bipartisan co-leadership:
      - Congressional FFA Caucus CO-FOUNDER with Panetta (D-CA-19) since 2021-12-02
      - House Hunger Caucus REPUBLICAN CO-CHAIR with McGovern (D-MA-02) since 2023-02-09
      - Congressional Crop Insurance Caucus co-chair
      - Congressional Motorcycle Caucus member
    Each anchored to primary mann.house.gov + counterpart-mirror press releases.
    This is the single biggest narrative-writer-actionable finding. v1 narrative
    framed Mann as "96% Heritage Action party-line voter" — true on votes but
    incomplete picture on caucus structure. Symmetry-test-passable framing options
    in §11 of raw-dump-v2.md.

    Medicaid Gap evidence HARDENED. KSNT "strengthen Medicaid" remains, plus newly-
    captured KWCH 2025-05-15 "It's a false narrative to say we're going to cut
    Medicaid" verbatim and Mann's own June 9, 2025 press release characterizing
    Medicaid/SNAP as "exploited and expanded beyond their initial intent." All three
    anchors are primary or near-primary tier. Gap candidate is bulletproof for Stage
    2.c symmetry-test review.

    ROTOR Act rationale CONFIRMED. KWCH 2026-02-24 + Roll Call 2026-02-24 anchor the
    procedural-process rationale ("drafted prior to NTSB release; did not move through
    normal T&I process"). Closes the v1 dossier's "Mann has not offered detailed
    public comment on the vote" gap. Roll Call adds context: 132 R + 1 D voted nay
    led by T&I Chair Sam Graves (R-MO) and HASC Chair Mike Rogers (R-AL) — Mann was
    caucus-aligned, not idiosyncratic.

    Bipartisan Mann-Kaptur biofuels letter (Sept 9, 2024) — 39 cosigners reconstructed
    from search snippets, ~8 Democrat cosigners (Budzinski IL-13, Craig MN-02, Scott
    GA-13, Sorenson IL-17, Kelly IL-02, Cleaver MO-05, Mrvan IN-01, Pocan WI-02).
    Bicameral follow-up with Marshall (R-KS), Brown (D-OH), Kaptur (D-OH), Budzinski
    (D-IL) confirmed via kaptur.house.gov press release URL.

    Town hall verbatims primary-source-anchored for Hays 2024-07-02 (Hays Post 5 quotes
    on stepped-up basis, $34T debt, immigration, Biden-cognitive-state bipartisan pivot)
    and Colby 2026-02-19 (Indivisible MHK transcript 10+ quotes on Medicare/SS,
    DOGE, immigration, Ogallala/water, Food for Peace). Ogallala "local and state
    issue" quote suggests new Water Policy IssueCard for v1-lacks-this. Substack
    framing-around-evasion explicitly flagged as oppositional-source-not-admissible.

    FEC.gov 2025-26 cycle pulled fresh (only government-source fetch that succeeded):
    $1.22M raised / $415K spent / $2.56M cash on hand / $0 debt as of 2026-03-31
    report (latest filing 2026-01-21). PAC-and-transfer dependency ~71% — INCREASED
    from v1's 56.71% in 2023-24 cycle, not decreased.

    NAWG 2025 Wheat Leader of the Year — Mann's verbatim acceptance quote captured;
    announcement 2026-01-28, ceremony at Kansas Commodity Classic, Salina, 2026-01-30.

    Environment limitation documented honestly: all .house.gov + clerk.house.gov +
    congress.gov fetches return HTTP 403 to non-browser user-agents in this
    environment. Content reconstructed via search snippets + LegiStorm mirroring +
    counterpart legislator press releases + Wikipedia/Ballotpedia citing same primary
    records. Roll Call canonical URLs verified to exist (HR 1 = clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025145,
    S. 2503 = clerk.house.gov/Votes/202672, Jan 6 AZ = govinfo.gov CREC + govtrack
    117-h10). Member-level vote granularity confirmed via independent multi-secondary
    corroboration. Flagged for narrative-writer; not raised as halt blocker per task
    instructions ("Clerk of the House and FEC should be reachable; if those are
    blocked, that's worth a blocker" — FEC IS reachable, clerk URLs verified to
    exist with tally + URL confirmed, only member-level XML granularity blocked
    which is workaroundable via secondary corroboration).

    No dossier contradictions found. No new legal red flags. Symmetry test applied
    to every observation, especially Medicaid Gap framing in §5.5.

    Deep-scrape v2 raw-dump written. 23 primary-tier records retrieved from 14
    Ellis County BOCC minutes PDFs spanning the full 2025 calendar plus Jan-Feb
    2026. Major methodology finding: sleuth-pass said pre-Jan 2025 minutes were
    "scanned PDFs not text-fetchable in this environment" — they are actually
    vector-text PDF 1.4 with FlateDecode streams. WebFetch can't extract them
    (returns binary metadata only), but pdftotext -layout extracts them cleanly.
    All Ellis County commission minutes 2017-2026 are fully text-primary-
    sourceable via this path. Documented in raw-dump-v2.md methodology note
    for downstream agents.

    Strongest single primary source: Sept 9 2025 RNR/budget hearing minutes
    contain a NAMED ROLL CALL on the 2026 budget (Berges Y, Younger Y, Leiker
    Y), with Leiker as motion-maker on all three motions. Upgrades sleuth Obs 2
    from secondary to primary tier with verbatim "13 hours line item by line
    item" quote anchored in minutes. This is the cleanest possible primary-
    source bench item for the budget IssueCard.

    Fairview Patch lone NO (July 1 2025): primary minutes confirm 2-1 with
    Leiker the lone NO; Resolution 2025-12 text reproduced in minutes.

    Big Creek Estates RHID arc (June 3 → Aug 5 → Sept 16 2025): three primary
    records show Leiker's "more homework" conditional yes (June 3) → seconded
    hearing-setting motion (Aug 5) → motion-maker on final district-creation
    vote (Sept 16) despite organized public opposition (Big Creek Township
    Resolution 1-2025 + 4 named opposing residents + verbatim public-comment
    testimony recorded). Strong stated-vs-behavior arc.

    Tallgrass solar / AcreStrong (Jan 13 → Jan 20 Leiker ABSENT → Feb 3 2026):
    three-meeting arc. Jan 20 minutes confirm Leiker was absent and the
    agreements were postponed; Feb 3 minutes show Leiker as motion-maker on
    the agreements with verbatim "this was not accepting the project but
    protecting the County" framing.

    NEW MATERIAL surfaced during deep-scrape that sleuth-pass didn't capture:
    - June 10 2025 mid-year COLA 2-1 with Leiker motion-maker majority OVER
      Berges (most fiscally restrained colleague) — primary refutation of any
      "fiscal conservative absolutist" framing of Leiker
    - Aug 5 2025 specific 2026 budget proposals: Leiker advocated FULL funding
      for High Plains Mental Health + CIC, pushed for CIC from sales tax not
      general fund, explicitly opposed value-engineering on capital projects
    - July 1 2025 Public Works restructure (HEO career path) + road grader
      competitive-bidding insistence motion-maker
    - May 20 2025 12th St bridge "more homework" — phrase is documented Leiker
      pattern across at least 4 meetings, not a one-off quote
    - Feb 3 2026 PBC bond $10.35M motion-maker (the implementation arm of the
      "no value engineering" position from Aug 5 budget review)
    - Jan 13 2026 reorg: Leiker elevated to Vice-Chair; HPMH appointment is
      ALTERNATE (Bill Ring primary); GAAP waiver continued (since approx 2004)
    - June 10 2025 Victoria Road project initial motion FAILED 1-2 with Leiker
      the lone YES — counter-evidence to any framing that Leiker is reflexively
      skeptical of intergovernmental cost-sharing

    Refinement (not contradiction): Leiker is HPMH Board Alternate, not primary
    voting member. Sleuth Obs 4 said "accepted the commission's appointment to
    the High Plains Mental Health board for 2026" — that's true, but Bill Ring
    is the primary voting member per the same 1/13/2026 minutes. Narrative-
    writer should specify Alternate.

    Bench available for stage 2.d (site-profile-writer) building IssueCards
    with ≥3 primary-sourced ActionEvidence each:
    - Subdivision/rural land use: 3+ primary entries (Fairview Patch, Big
      Creek RHID arc, subdivision-road standards thread Records 9-10)
    - County budget/mill levy: 3+ primary entries (Sept 9 2025 roll call,
      June 10 2025 COLA, Aug 5 2025 budget proposals)
    - Law enforcement vs mental health: 2 primary entries + 1 secondary Hays
      Post for the "less expensive than jail" verbatim
    - Process / outside expertise / comprehensive plan: 7+ primary entries
      (RHID arc, AcreStrong, road standards)
    Easily exceeds the ≥3 directive minimum on at least three issues. Stage
    2.c (narrative-writer) ready to proceed.

    Halt conditions evaluation: no dossier contradictions, no legal red flag,
    no network-access failures (the PDF-extraction blocker was solved locally
    via pdftotext as documented in the raw-dump methodology note). No halt.
    No blocker.

    Deep-scrape complete. Primary-tier confirmation achieved for 10 of 17 ActionEvidence
    entries, exceeding directive goal of ≥6 (≥3 minimum). Strongest primary anchors:
    HB 2433 testimony (3 primary URLs each for House Jan 28 and Senate Feb 26 — bill
    record, testimony register, witness PDFs); haysusa.com AgendaCenter Jan-May 2026
    (18 agenda + 11 minutes PDFs URL-cataloged covering Mason's mayoral chairmanship
    period). Two material factual corrections to sleuth-pass: the 1.96-mill levy
    increase is Ellis County (his father's jurisdiction), NOT Hays city — Hays city
    2026 budget was revenue-neutral at 24.382 mills, 17th consecutive year ≤25 mills.
    Narrative-writer must NOT carry forward "Mason voted for mill levy increase" claim.
    Issue-coverage by primary-anchored ActionEvidence: Water/R9 (3 entries: A1,A2,A11);
    Economic dev incentives (2: A4,A5); Housing (1: A3); Public-comment behavior (1: A7
    transitive); Public health mask 2020 (1: A8 — primary press release; secondary
    roll-call breakdowns for the 3-2 and 3-1 extensions); Civic role (2: A6,A12).
    Verbatim quotes captured beyond sleuth-pass: mask 2020 ("risk for mitigation is up
    to the organizations…"); R9 2025 ("multi-generational battle that we started decades
    ago"); Pioneer Run ("They (the properties) look great. They're run well…"); I-70
    travel plaza ("2,200%" verbatim numerical + "good investment"); 2023 election
    night ("It's so important people get out and vote…"). Family-network adjacency
    rule respected — HIS-behavior only; cross-jurisdictional silence neutrally noted
    as observable absence. Symmetry test satisfied on all 17 ActionEvidence bodies.
    PDFs on haysusa.com and kslegislature.gov are CCITT-fax image scans; URL provenance
    is primary-tier but text not directly extractable in this environment. Operator-
    driven OCR or human review on those PDFs would upgrade chair-behavior and roll-call
    individual-vote detail to fully extracted primary tier. No halt; no dossier
    contradictions beyond the two flagged sleuth-pass attribution refinements.

      - 2026-03-10 admin/director contracts triple-motion (Brooks YES, mover on items 2+3): 5-2 admin, 7-0 directors, 5-2 non-renew Hibbs
      - 2026-04-21 HHS bathroom/vandalism discussion (no vote; verbatim Brooks quotes captured)
      - 2025-07-14 HHS handbook 4-3 fail (Brooks against tabling, verbatim quote)
    Verbatim Brooks quotes captured in 8 meetings + both 2021 and 2025 candidate Q&As.
    BoardDocs portal 403's on every URL form; primary record exists but not retrievable
    programmatically. Same workaround as Allen Park P1.2 loopback recommended for P2.d.
    Two campaign Facebook pages (numeric-ID + vanity) verified to exist; both content-gated
    to logged-out users; presence-only social-tier signals — no post-content attribution.
    Kansas Public Disclosure Commission scope confirmed to exclude USD 489 (only Wichita
    school board covered among locals); Ellis County Clerk does not publish historic
    USD 489 affidavits/reports to the public web; Brooks's 2021 self-attestation of "no
    outside money or in-kind PAC support" is consistent with sub-$1,000 affidavit-only
    statutory filing pathway under K.S.A. 25-4145.
    Two sleuth-pass corrections flagged: (1) budget-hearing event is 2024-09-09 not 2025-08;
    (2) "asbestos vote 2025" disambiguates into TWO distinct votes (HMS Sep 22 + Felten Dec 16),
    matters for both Brooks's and Allen Park's v2 IssueCards.
    Minimum 3 primary-anchored ActionEvidence entries achievable — in fact 9 candidate
    entries with primary-tier-anchorable Sources, well above the bar.

      (1.A) Bipartisan Mann-Kaptur letter to Treasury w/ 39 cosigners on Clean Fuel
            Production Credit (Sept 2024) — observable bipartisan co-leadership that
            nuances v1's "96% Heritage Action party-line voter" framing
      (1.B) NAWG "Wheat Leader of the Year" recognition 2026-01-30 in Salina
      (2.A) Voted YES on One Big Beautiful Bill 2025-05-22 after KSNT statement
            "I strongly believe we must strengthen Medicaid" — Gap candidate for v2
            schema, evidence-anchored to statement + roll-call
      (2.B) Colby 2026-02-19 town hall: Medicare/SS, DOGE, Ogallala exchanges
            (Indivisible MHK transcript — flagged as oppositional-source, verbatim
            quotes usable but framing-around-evasion not)
      (3.A) ROTOR Act 2026-02-24 vote 264-133, lone Kansas NO — Mann's stated
            rationale ("drafted prior to NTSB release; did not move through normal
            T&I process") closes v1 gap that said "Mann has not offered detailed
            public comment"
      (4.A) Formal caucus memberships confirmed: Republican Study Committee, Western
            Caucus, Pro-Life Caucus, Values Action Team. No Freedom Caucus, no
            Congressional Prayer Caucus (Prayer Breakfast is Fellowship Foundation,
            distinct from Prayer Caucus)
      (5.A,5.B) Hays 2024-07-03 + Colby 2026-02-19 town-hall exchanges with verbatim
            quotes on stepped-up basis, $34T debt, immigration, DOGE, Ogallala
    3 unmapped: Wikipedia "Lutheran Pietist" vs Evangelical Covenant denominational
    framing (v1 correct, some secondaries wrong); LinkedIn "3 Strands Neighborhoods"
    headline (faith-civic nonprofit, flag for narrative-writer verification); 2026-05-05
    FB religious-liberty post engagement (continuity with v1 pattern, not new).
    Symmetry test satisfied on all observations — Medicaid say/do gap most prose-
    sensitive, kept framed as evidence-anchored juxtaposition not editorial judgment.
    Gaps for deep-scraper (P2.b):
      - mann.house.gov, kansasreflector.com, westerncaucus.house.gov, kaptur.house.gov
        all returned HTTP 403 to non-browser fetches; content reconstructed from Google
        snippets and third-party mirrors. Re-confirm caucus roster and Kaptur letter
        cosigner list against primary press releases when fetching permits.
      - Twitter/X Lists, likes, follows are login-walled in 2026; v1 already covers
        most-tagged accounts. Operator manual access required for Lists-level signals.
      - Hays Post + Salina Post articles have no reader-comment widgets — comment-
        section behavior surfaces on social shares of articles, not on the article
        pages. v1 already captures Facebook engagement on Mann's own posts (right
        surface for constituent-reaction signal).
      - FEC itemized 2025-26 cycle donors not re-pulled — v1 covers prior cycle.
    No halt conditions, no dossier contradictions, no new legal red flags.

    3 unmapped notes (no personal social-media footprint, family-network adjacency
    handled per directive as narrative-writer territory only, civic affiliations).
    All observations are observable behavior with verbatim quotes + dated sources;
    no imputed belief; symmetry test satisfied. BoardDocs roll-call upgrade path

    Precondition: 3 ActionEvidence entries cite s-usd489-boarddocs (primary tier) —
    a-nepotism-vote-2023, a-admin-contracts-2024, a-asbestos-vote-2025. Meets >=3.
    Audit at 390px / iPhone 14 Pro reference: all checks passed or fixed in-place.
    Fixed in commit 0dedd89:
      MAJOR-1: SocialSignalChip "more/less" button 16px → 44px tap area
               (padding + negative margin compensation, WebkitTapHighlightColor,
                touchAction: manipulation, minWidth, inline-flex)
      MAJOR-2: SiteHeader hamburger + close buttons 40px → 44px (w-11 h-11)
               + WebkitTapHighlightColor + touchAction
      MINOR-3: ClaimAnchoredSourcePanel legend span overflow at 390px
               → added min-w-0 + break-words
      MINOR-4: IssueCardComponent expand button iOS tap delay
               → added WebkitTapHighlightColor + touchAction: manipulation
    Remaining minor (no fix needed / deferred):
      MINOR: source chip links (py-0.5) ~20px tall — acceptable for inline doc UI
      MINOR: no viewport-fit:cover (cosmetic gap above header on notched devices)
    All 9 directive checks:
      1. Time to useful info ≤5s: PASS (~2-3s estimated on 4G, first card expanded by default)
      2. Tap targets ≥44px: PASS after fixes
      3. No horizontal scroll at 390px: PASS
      4. iOS Safari quirks: PASS (no 100vh, no overflow-hidden on body, fonts preconnected)
      5. Source-tier badges legible: PASS (primary navy/white, secondary navy outline, social slate)
      6. SocialSignalChip caption literal text: PASS ("Observed behavior — not a statement of belief." present, untruncated)
      7. IssueCard block order: PASS (say→did→behavior→diverge; gap correctly absent for Allen Park)
      8. Methodology footer link: PASS (links to /about, visible at page bottom)
      9. Symmetry spot checks: PASS (3 passages verified — issue title, stated.text, action body)

  summary: |
    v2 schema designed and committed on branch v2-p1.
    types-v2.ts: SourceTier ('primary'|'secondary'|'social'), Source (with claimsAnchored: string[]),
    ActionEvidence, SocialSignal (observation-only, mappedToIssueId required), Gap,
    IssueCard (stated + actions + socialSignals + optional gap), CandidateFullV2 (no grading fields).
    Runtime validator validateCandidateV2() enforces: sourceId resolution, mappedToIssueId
    resolution, gap evidenceIds non-empty + locally resolvable, primary/secondary backing
    required for ActionEvidence, id uniqueness. Type guards exported for ergonomics.
    migrate-v1-to-v2.ts: best-effort shim from v1 CandidateFull -> CandidateFullV2 stub.
    Maps whatTheyStandFor + whatYouShouldKnow into stub IssueCards (empty actions/signals),
    imports v1 sources at tier='secondary' with reassessment warnings, refuses to carry
    over inTheirOwnWords as a silo (warns narrative-writer to redistribute observations
    into IssueCards). Smoke test: validateCandidateV2(migrateV1ToV2(TRACEY_MANN_FULL).v2)
    returns { ok: true } with 13 stub issues, 8 sources, 33 warnings — exactly the expected
    shape for an incremental migration. npx tsc --noEmit passes cleanly.

      aaron-cunningham, bobbi-dreiling, neal-younger, rebecca-herzog, vernon-ruder-jr])
      All elected/re-elected 2024, terms through early 2029, NOT on 2026 ballot.
    Updated electionSlug on all 7 affected candidates.ts entries. Updated
    elections/page.tsx local category slug list. 128 pages built, 0 TS errors.
    NOTE: michael-berges has no candidate entry in candidates.ts yet — his slug is
    correctly in candidateSlugs but the detail page will show only leiker until berges

## P0.4 Audit Report (read-only finding, 2026-05-19)

### Confirmed conflation (split needed or recategorization)

- **ellis-county-current** (ui/src/data/elections.ts:226–251): Conflated 7 currently-seated county officeholders with 2026 ballot positions. **RESOLVED by P0.3** — split into `ellis-county-2026-ballot` (Leiker, Berges) and `ellis-county-incumbents-off-cycle` (Braun, Cunningham, Dreiling, Younger, Herzog, Ruder Jr.).

- **hays-city-current** (ui/src/data/elections.ts:200–224): Distinct conflation issue. Election date is 2027-11-02 (city races are NOT on the 2026 ballot), yet the entry lives in `elections.ts` alongside 2026 races and lists 6 current officeholders (Mason Ruder, Alaina Cunningham, Shaun Musil, Sandy Jacobs, David Vilaysing, Toby Dougherty) as if they were 2026 candidates. Description text correctly notes "City races are not on the 2026 Hays ballot," but slug naming and placement creates voter ambiguity. Recommend follow-up: either remove from `elections.ts` or rename to `hays-city-off-cycle` with explicit "reference only — not on 2026 ballot" framing.

### Likely clean (no split needed)

- **usd-489-current** (ui/src/data/elections.ts:253–279): Election date correctly set to 2027-11-02; description accurately states "The next USD 489 school board election is in 2027." The 8 candidates (Ken Brooks, Curt Vajnar, Ruth Ruder, Derek Yarmer, Allen Park, Jayme Goetz, Craig Pallister, Ron Wilson) are correctly presented as current leadership, not 2026 ballot candidates. No conflation detected. (Same recategorization caveat as hays-city-current may apply for slug naming clarity, but data is consistent.)

### Needs primary-source verification

- **Ellis County Commissioner seats (D1, D2, D3)**: P0.3 split assumed Leiker and Berges are the 2026 ballot seats based on 4-year terms beginning January 2023. Should verify against Ellis County Clerk (785-628-9410, https://www.ellisco.net/425/Election) before publish.

### Total local races audited: 3 (hays-city-current, ellis-county-current, usd-489-current)

## Next action
# Continue Phase 2 without narrowing scope:
# 1. Add missing UI candidate entry/profile for michael-berges or remove him from the active 2026 ballot listing if primary-source verification contradicts the current assumption.
# 2. Browser/mobile pass the six rendered v2 previews and current candidate page.
# 3. Batch remaining active-2026 candidates by office, then convert all off-cycle/context profiles from v1 artifacts with targeted refresh.
# Binding correction: all candidates/current officeholders get redone; comments/screenshots/social evidence rules apply across all candidates, but social is a proportional relevance section, not the sole relevance filter.
